It includes ensuring efficient processes (sustainable development) through standardisation, documented tools like catalogues and metadata, promoting diversity in representation, and providing inclusive training techniques without jargon for all levels.

- Evidence explanation:... The context explicitly links sustainable development approaches within digital technologies to roles involving enabling tools (IT), represented by points 4 (Sustainable development - Efficient processes, remove unnecessary a. Documented) and the IT stakeholder point (To enable tools and access). Diversity and inclusion are addressed under points 2 (Diversity - Ensure all groups...), 3 (Inclusive - All-levels training...), and implicitly supported by the efficient process goal.
