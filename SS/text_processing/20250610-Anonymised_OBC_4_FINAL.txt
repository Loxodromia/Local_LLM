NAME OF PROJECT  OUTLINE BUSINESS CAS E – CAT B 
Executive Summary  
The NAME OF TEAM  delivers c. NUMBER OF DELIVERABLES  to provide  
operational and training capability for multiple end users  across Defence.  
 
The CUSTOMER  has their support activities  performed under the existing ‘In 
Service Support’ (ISS) Contract s which are due to expire DATE . This project seeks 
to re -assess the market to ensure continued Value for Money (VfM ) under new 
seven (XXXX ) year’ contract s, ‘In Service Support  YEAR  - YEAR ’ (ISS DATE ), to 
ensure ongoing delivery of the enduring capability provided by NAME OF 
DEPARTMENT  DELIVERABLES . 
 
Approval is sought to enable a competitive negotiated commercial process to take 
place, so that contracts can be awarded effective DATE . Failure to deliver in -
service support will lead to loss of operational capability across Defence . The 
project is  high volume, but  low risk and low technical complexity.  
 
Issue  
1. Approval for the project to begin a competitive negotiated procurement exercise , to 
allow NAME OF OTHER DEPARTMENT 1 to re-test the market to ensure that VfM is 
delivered  and ongoing in -service support to the NAME OF DEPARTMENT 
DELIVERABLE s CUSTOMER  is provided following expiry of the existing contracts on 
DATE .  
Timing  
2. Routine.   Approval is required by DATE (NAME OF OTHER DEPARTMENT 1 ), 
DATE (NAME OF OTHER DEPARTMENT 2 ) and  DATE (NAME OF OTHER 
DEPARTMENT 3 ), to maintain the critical path to Contract Award and mitigate the risk of 
the   CUSTOMER  becoming unsupported.  
Recommendation(s)  
3. The Approving Authority  is invited to  approv e: 
a.  Progression to a zero -cost assessment phase with formal industrial 
engagement through release of the Contract Notice , DPQQ  and subsequent ITN 
documentation .   
4. The Approving Authority is also invited to note :  
a. The Control Total  (CT) allocated to provision of in -service support from DATE

c. The forecast cost is £ XXXX  (Annex A) , giving a delta of £  XXXX . This will be 
managed via  a Limit of Liability  (LoL)  and market engagement will be at the LoL 
level so that if the agreed provision is not increased there will be no risk of legal 
action.

d. An affordable FBC will be presented . The affordability challenge will be 
addressed via several routes:  
i. A bid to increase agreed provision in PCR 1 -DATE ; or 
ii. Using the framework arrangement within the contract  so the number of 
DELIVERABLE  supported can be tailored; and/or  
iii. Utilising FLC underspends via Review Note; and 
iv. Introducing efficiencies within the contract ; and  
v. running the competition to achieve the best VfM.  
e. The schedule to Contract Award  at Annex D has been baselined and a n SRA 
has been conducted which indicates a X% pre -mitigated and X% post mitigated 
chance of delivery to schedule . Post mitigation, the SRA has indicated project end 
dates (including Project Evaluation) as:  
i. 10% = DATE  
ii. 50% = DATE  
iii. 90% = DATE  
  f. The Key User Requirements a t Annex B will be met by the recommended 
option.  
g. The significant risks to delivery at Annex G centre around affordability . All 
relevant risks have been incorporated into the cost models and schedule presented . 
However, there is no intention to spend beyond the agreed provision  and an 
affordabl e FBC will be presented.  
Strategic Case  
5. The NAME OF OTHER DEPARTMENT 3 , NAME OF OTHER DEPARTMENT 4 , and 
NAME OF OTHER DEPARTMENT 5  require a highly available and reliable  capability to 
deliver endorsed Defence Tasks . The DELIVERABLE s CUSTOMER  delivers  against 
operational and training  Statement of Need(s) and Key User Requirements (KURs) 
(Annex B) . This p rovide s a timely provision of available DELIVERABLE s, along with the 
ability to respond to increasing demands, which sits at the heart of improving platform 
availability.  
 
6. The DELIVERABLE s CUSTOMER  is comprised of c.NUMBER OF  
DELIVERABLE s, ranging in complexity from DELIVERABLE s, to NUMBER  PXXXX  
DELIVERABLES . From  DATE  to DATE , DELIVERABLE s have been supported by the 
DELIVERABLE s In Service Support (ISS) contract s. The ISS contract s separates  the 
DELIVERABLE s into NUMBER OF separate ‘lots’ based on user need and location, and  
is currently delivered by NUMBER  service providers (Annex C). The support delivered 
includes but is not limited to:  
 
• Scheduled preventative maintenance ; 
• Reactive maintenance, defect rectification, and repair ; 
• Mid Life Upgrades ; 
• Replacement and/or replenishment of existing DELIVERABLE  with 
DELIVERABLE s; 
• On-site support ; 
• Supply of spares ; 
• Post Design Services (PDS) ; 
• Testing and trials ; 
• Configuration, obsolescence, and documentation management . 
 
7. Learning from Experience ( LfE) was conducted on the ISS contract,  and the most 
significant points incorporated into the proposed ISS DATE  design, specifically:  
• Lot structure and allocation – fewer lots with amended DELIVERABLE  allocation 
(Annex H) ; 
• Tasking processes – easier process with increased opportunity for automation ; 
• Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Performance Management – introduction 
of two amended and two additional KPIs to deliver increased contract 
performance, with financial redress and incentivisation added to contract (Annex 
H); 
• Increased clarity of w ording in each of  the Statement of Technical Requirements 
(SOTR) and Tariff items.  
  8. The LfE incorporated delivers two key objectives: to incorporate changed 
operational needs, and to create efficiencies in the administrative end -to-end processes. 
A full logic model  is included at Annex F.   
 
9. The changed operational needs reflect changes to the DELIVERABLE s in-scope 
(detailed in the DELIVERABLE s Matrix). Whilst some DELIVERABLE s have been 
disposed since YEAR , DELIVERABLE s have been acquired since the introduction of ISS 
with in-service support provided via design, manufacture and initial support contracts with 
the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The policy of DELIVERABLE s Team is that 
post acquisition contract, these DELIVERABLE s will be subsumed into  the overarching 
support solution at time of contract renewal; as a result,  support  currently  provided by five 
additional  contracts is also in scope of ISS DATE  (Annex C) .  
 
10. Failure to provide in -service support to all DELIVERABLE s will result in lapsed 
safety cases, which in turn will lead to a rapid and progressive withdrawal from service, 
and therefore inability to deliver KURs and endorsed Defence Tasks. It is therefore 
proposed, after conducting a full options appraisal (see ‘Economic Case’), that a new 
contract for NUMBER OF  years is awarded to replace ISS, to be known as the 
DELIVERABLE s In Service Support YEAR  – YEAR  (ISS DATE ) Contract.  
 
11. The schedule has factored in both time and resource implications to conduct the 
tender process. The schedule is now fully baselined (Annex D) and the lessons learned 
from previous DELIVERABLE s projects have enabled accurate resource allocation. The 
DELIVERABLES  project controls assurance community has reviewed this schedule and 
provided their assurance against it.  
12. The project falls within the DEPARTMENT  Strategy Refresh and as such, 
represents a substantial opportunity over the next NUMBER  years to support and 
develop the UK’s healthy capacity in DELIVERABLE  and refit / repair . There is a clear 
interface with the strategic objective s of the DEPARTMENT  Strategy YEAR  and the 
potential to deliver on cross -government industrial policy, which is being tracked by the 
DEPARTMENT  Office.  
Economic Case  
13. The Project Team undertook a full options analysis, including evaluating the historic 
approach to  DELIVERABLE s In Service Support Contracts and funding for the contract. 
The options presented in Table 2 were considered, and are detailed in Annex E.  
Option  Summary  
(1) Do Nothing  Allow ISS to lapse leaving all DELIVERABLE s unsupported 
and KURs undelivered.  
(2) Extend Existing 
Contracts  (Business As 
Usual)  Extend existing contracts to continue to deliver KURs. KURs 
only partially delivered as acquisitions since ISS are not 
included. VfM is not achieved ; some contractors may not accept 
invitation to extend contract ; no opportunity for new suppliers ; 
known  issues persist.  There is no Commercial  justification to 
extend beyond 7 years without risking a legal challenge.  
(3) Mirror ISS Create new contract based on ISS. KURs only partially delivered 
as acquisitions since ISS are not included. Known issues 
persist.  
(4) Do Minimum  – Evolve 
ISS Recommended 
Option  Gather LfE to improve ISS contract to eradicate known issues 
and make more efficient . Incorporate new acquisitions to deliver  against all KURs . Remove DELIVERABLE  disposed of post 
ISS. 
(5) Fully Re -Write ISS Develop a completely new contract  ignoring all aspects of ISS 
that currently work well . This option creates a strong  risk that the 
work will not be complete prior to DATE , leaving KURs at risk of 
being unsupported.  This is the riskiest and most expensive 
option.  
(6) Contract for Availabil ity Develop elements of the ISS contract to include contracting for 
availability, instead of using a framework agreement. KURs are 
delivered. However, t here is a strong risk that the Control Total 
is breached  due to the volume of DELIVERABLE s being 
maintained . This drives risk and hence cost into an industrial 
base not used to managing that throughput, and because a 
significant minority of our CUSTOMER  (e.g. STAFF  
DELIVERABLE s) would not benefit from an availability -type 
contract because they are used on an ad -hoc basis and 
therefore do not have true availability metrics.  
Table 3: ISS DATE  Options  
 
Commercial Case  
14. A Commercial Strategy has been prepared and should be read in conjunction with 
this Outline Business Case. Summary points are provided in this section.  
15. ISS DATE  is largely a continuation of current arrangements, supporting 
DELIVERABLE s which in most cases have been in service for a number of years. There 
is only a need to re -approve because NAME OF OTHER DEPARTMENT 1 needs to re -
test the market to validate VfM, particularly in the light of wider economic and market 
turbulence since YEAR . 
16. The Defence Sourcing Portal (DSP) was used to publish an  open  invitation to an 
Industry Day held at LOCATION  on DATE , which was attended by over 70 
representatives of  c. 30 suppliers.  
17. A Market Survey Questionnaire  (MSQ)  was also distributed to incumbent suppliers  
during DATE .  
18. The Industry Day and MSQ had two purposes:  
a. To generate interest in the procurement ; 
b. To gather LfE f rom ISS to consider for inclusion in ISS DATE . 
 
19. As some of DELIVERABLE s carry munitions, this procurement falls within the scope 
of the Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations  YEAR  (DSPCR YEAR ). To 
allow for face -to-face discussion and clarification of each Tenderers’ proposal, the 
Competitive Negotiated procedure, under DSPCR YEAR , will be utilised.  
20. The Competitive Negotiated procedure  will help to ensure the NAME OF 
DEPARTMENT ’s technical requirement is met and will secure best VfM as the contract 
will be awarded through fair and open competition and advertised in the Defence 
Contracts Bulletin (DCB) and the Defence Sourcing Portal (DSP).  
21. A Dynamic Pre -Qualification Questionnaire (DPQQ) will be used to down -select  
from those expressing interest through DSP to go forward to IT N. The DPQQ will be used  to look at basic capability and financial health of the participants. All interested parties will 
be listed in the resulting Full Business Case (FBC).  
22. At ITN, a Most Economically  Advantageous Tender  (MEAT) evaluation  using the 
VfM Index (including up to two rounds of negotiation ) will be used to decide winners  of 
each respective lot . The MEAT evaluation will be based on technical competency, firm 
price tariff items and spares, and hourly rates for unplanned activity.  
23. A Lot Allocation Mechanism will then be used to award Lots in order of priority and 
to ensure that NAME OF DEPARTMENT  is not exposed to potential providers over -
committing themselves. It is anticipated that there will be a minimum of 3 and a maximum 
of 9 successful bidders  who will be invited to enter  a contract with the NAME OF 
DEPARTMENT . 
24. Risk:   A full project risk identification and analysis has been carried out for this 
procurement. This includes commercial risks and will continue to be updated and refined 
as the procurement progresses . The Risk and Complexity (RCA) Matrix  for ISS DATE  
highlights the minimal level of technical and commercial risk . All risks have been 
recorded in the Risks and Issues Register  and on ARM (Annex G). 
 
Financial Case  
25. A cost modelling exercise has been undertaken to determine affordability. The 
exercise was conducted by SQEP within the DELIVERABLE s team , creating the cost 
model from the lowest level of data available, as shown in figure 1: 
 
Figure 1: Creation of the ISS DATE  Cost Model  
26. The affordability challenge in this OBC is a result of several DELIVERABLE s 
requiring Out of Service Date (OSD) extensions  as replacement DELIVERABLE s projects 
have not been implemented by ORGANISATION  Dev, whilst capability requirement 
remains enduring . This has been highlighted in a note to ORGANISATION  Command.  
Subsequent detailed cost modelling has highlighted a total shortfall of £  XXXX against 
CT (table 3). This affordability challenge will be addressed by a bid to increase CT 
allocated to ISS DATE  via PCR1 -DATE , being progressed currently . If this PCR uplift is 
implemented, it is expected tha t an affordable FBC will then be presented.

RMC  XXXX  XXXX  XXXX  
Table 4: Control Total versus Cost Model  
27. If PCR1 -DATE  is unable to be implemented or is not implemented in time to support 
an FBC approval, the proposed contracting strategy is for a  framework contract which 
does not guarantee any throughput. As a result,  throughput and scope of in -service 
support activity can be tailored to meet budget , with the short duration of typical activities 
giving an option  to take advantage of in -year underspe nds from elsewhere within FLCs 
(to be approved via Review Note or standalone  Business Case  as required ).  
28. The Cost Model has been reviewed at high level  by the DELIVERABLES  Cost 
Assurance Group (CAG) . Final costs will be confirmed , verified and validated,  in the Full 
Business Case after the competition  has co ncluded .   
29. The affordability analysis for the Limit of Liability  (LoL) of ISS DATE  is set out in 
Table 4 below  (inclusive of RMC) . The breakdown per FLC can be found in Annex A .iii.

31. FOREX . There is no FOREX exposure as bid prices provided by suppliers will be in

32. VAT and accounting treatment . Assumptions applied in the cost model have been 
confirmed by the ORGANISATION  Tax Team  (Financial Accounting Tax Enabling Team  / 
ORGANISATION  Fin FA-Tax1a) .  33. Contingent Liability . The DELIVERABLE s team are in the process of conducting a 
Contingent Liability risk assessment , however, the team does not anticipate there being a 
Contingent Liability at this time , or for a Contingent Liability to be presented in the FBC.  
34. The associated Raw Materials and Consumables (RMC) and Single Use Military 
Inventory (SUMI) cost of £ XXXX  is included within the affordability table . 
35. Private Sector Support (PSS). An assessment has been conducted and no Private 
Sector Support is anticipated in the ISS DATE  contract.  
Management Case  
36. Programme Governance.  ISS DATE  will follow the prescribed route for funding 
and approval arrangements relevant to a Category B project  in accordance with JSP655 .   
37. Programme Milestones. The four programme milestones are OBC, FBC, IOC and 
FOC with definitions and criteria detailed in Table 5 below:

Table 6: Programme Milestones  
38. Risk. Risks and Issues associated with the project are captured in Annex G.  The 
most significant risks are:  
a. Resource . There is insufficient resource in the team to successfully deliver the 
project and some key posts, such as Requirements Manager and Risk Manager, 
are still gapped . The risk is being mitigated by utilising PDP contractor resource and  
drawing upon subject matter expertise from the Risk Management resource pool.  
During the contract, care is being taken to ensure that any process engineering 
does not impact on the Operational Management t eam’s capacity to manage the 
contract.  
b. Affordability. Significant effort has been made to achieve affordability and 
mitigate risks accordingly. However, inflation above the expected level  leading to 
increased  contractor costs may still mean a further increase in affordability pressure  
once all bids have been received at ITN/FBC stage.   
c. Contract Termination. If the contract is terminated by NAME OF 
DEPARTMENT  or at short notice by the provider due to, for example, insolvency , 
there needs to be a mechanism in the contract for DELIVERABLE s to remain 
supported. Work is underway to address how this mechanism will work in practice.   d. General Election. The date of the General Election poses a risk to the project 
schedule if key decision points cannot be completed (for example, NAME OF 
OTHER DEPARTMENT 3  approval of OBC and FBC ). 
39. Operating Model.  The contract will not greatly change the principles of the 
DELIVERABLE s Team’s operating model . However, fewer lots  and improved processes  
may result in a decreased administration burden across the team.  
40. Performance Measurements.  The revised KPIs used in this contract are designed 
to deliver increased performance from suppliers, together with improved performance 
measurements. Changing the way that data is collected from suppliers and handled 
internally will result in improved performance reporting, and new Management 
Information allowing trend analysis and further evolution of the way that In Service 
Support is delivered by the team.  
41. Learning from Experience.  LfE has been undertaken during project initiation. 
Evaluation will continue to be completed post OBC approval and prior to FBC 
submission . 
42.  Schedule. The project schedule was baselined on DATE  and is included at Annex 
D. 
43. A high -level version of the schedule is shown in Figure 2 . Note: The next approval 
point is for FBC in DATE . 
REDACTED  
44. Schedule Risk Analysis  (SRA) : An SRA has been conducted which indicates a 
17% pre-mitigated  and 43% post mitigated  chance of delivery to schedule. Post Contract 
Award, the schedule will be managed on a Level of Effort basis in accordance with 
Project Controls tailoring appropriate to service delivery.  
45. The schedule assumes contract start date will be no later than DATE , driven by the 
dependency of the current ISS contract expiration date of DATE . A fallback plan is 
included in the Commercial Strategy in the case that this is not achieved.  
Presentation and Handling  
46. ISS DATE  is unlikely to attract any significant political or media interest directly  if the 
programme proceeds to plan  as it continues to deliver what previous contracts have 
delivered . 
47. As this programme is being delivered under DSPCR YEAR , there is significant 
potential for positive messaging as this programme supports the DEPARTMENT  Strategy 
and UK industrial and SME capability for the next seven years. This opportunity will be 
managed in collaboration with the DEPARTMENT  Office.  
48. However, failure of the programme would mean a withdrawal of DELIVERABLE s 
and this could attract significant media interest  as this would result in:  
a. Loss of capabilities provided by the DELIVERABLE s CUSTOMER ;  b. Consequential loss of capabilities  provided by all ORGANISATION  
DELIVERABLES . DELIVERABLE s are a fundamental part of DELIVERABLES ’ 
Safety Case , and additionally provide waterborne escorts of CASD.  
49. The provision of both STAFF s and Adventurous Training capabilities are emotive 
issues  for the general public, and deliver specific benefit to the military, particularly 
around recruitment and retention:  
a.   STAFF  DELIVERABLE s provide the equipment  to deliver to two national 
youth organisations:  STAFF s and the Combined  STAF F. Both provide opportunities 
for young people to grow and develop . These organisations act as a breeding 
ground for the next generation of recruits.  
b. Adventurous Training DELIVERABLE s provide the equipment to deliver 
experiences to  improve physical and mental robustness, allowing existing defence 
staff to stay fit and learn new skills. This provision is a key part of recruitment and 
retention of Army and ORGANISATION  personnel  at a period when both 
recruitment and retention is challenging.   
50. There has been a significant historic investment  in acquiring and maintaining the   
CUSTOMER  of DELIVERABLE s supported by ISS DATE , so failing to fully utilise the   
CUSTOMER  will not present VfM for the taxpayer.   
51. If funding for DELIVERABLE s is removed, there would be a resultant cost to 
decommission  and / or dispose  of DELIVERABLE s in good working order . Media interest 
may question why Defence is reducing capability at a time of global volatility.

   Analysis of Options taken forward  
 
 
Option  2. Extend ISS 
Extend existing contracts to continue to deliver KURs. KURs only 
partially delivered as acquisitions since ISS are not included. VfM is not 
achieved; some contractors may not accept invitation to extend contract; 
no opportunity for new suppliers; known issues persist. There is no 
Commercial justification to extend beyond X years without risking a legal 
challenge.  
SMART 
Objective  1. Contract  R Does not deliver the full contract as an extension will not be 
approved for X years.  However, it could work as an interim solution.  
Not all KURs are delivered (Annex C). 
Critical 
Success 
Factors  Strategic Fit  R KURs are only partially delivered as new DELIVERABLE  have 
come into scope of ISS DATE  that were not in ISS (Annex C). 
There are some known issues (captured in LfE) within the ISS 
contract which impair delivery and so extending the contract will not 
address the known issues.  
Value for 
Money  R This option does not include running a competition to test the 
market for VfM, and there is a risk that suppliers may inflate their 
costs  under this option.  There is also no Commercially justifiable 
rationale to extend the contract beyond the current X year contract 
without risking a legal challenge.  New suppliers are excluded . 
Supplier 
Capacity  A Some existing contractors already have difficulties in delivering the 
ISS contract . This option assumes that all existing suppliers will 
accept an invitation for the contract to be extended, which may not 
be the case.  There is no opportunity for new providers to take part 
in this contract which is significant within the DELIVERABLE s 
sector.  
Affordability  R Due to the risks of inflated costs, this option is unlikely to be 
affordable.   This is a short -term and expensive solution which will 
be resource -hungry to implement . Longer -term, the ISS contract will 
still need to be renegotiated, so duplication of effort will occur under 
this option.  
Achievability  A This option is achievable , but there is no commercial justification to 
extend ISS, increasing the risk of a successful legal challenge.  
Summary  Not Recommended  
 
 
 
Option  3. Mirror ISS 
Create new contract based on ISS. KURs only partially delivered  as 
acquisitions since ISS are not included. Known issues persist.  
SMART 
Objective  1. Contract  R This option partially  meets SMART objective #1 .  Not all KURs are 
met as new acquisitions since ISS are not included (Annex C). 
Underlying the KURs in Annex C are the detailed requirements 
which include individual DELIVERABLE  as named in the 
DELIVERABLE s Matrix (refer to supporting documentation). In 
ISS there are  NUMBER OF  DELIVERABLE  which are currently 
supported that will not be part of ISS DATE . Additionally, there are 
481 DELIVERABLE  that have been acquired since ISS. To 
mirror ISS would therefore result in an incorrect number and mix of 
DELIVERABLE s supported and as such, current KURs would 
not be met.  
Critical 
Success 
Factors  Strategic Fit  R DELIVERABLE s are partly supported to deliver KURs, but L fE is 
not incorporated into the contract meaning that known issues 
persist  and the opportunities to improve service for end users is not 
delivered . 
Value for 
Money  A VfM will be pa rtially achieved through market engagement .  
However, LfE will not be leveraged fully , so contract improvements  with the potential to deliver efficiencies will not be implemented . 
Time taken to collect L fE will be wasted.  
Supplier 
Capacity  G The market will be tested during a competition whereby suppliers 
will be able to bid for the Lots and evaluated against their bids.  
Affordability  A Issues arise around the DELIVERABLE s currently not in scope 
of ISS (Annex C). Additional funding would need to be secured to 
cover these DELIVERABLE . 
Achievability  A The ISS contract does not cover a number of current 
DELIVERABLE  (Annex C), meaning that several contracts would 
need to be written in addition to ISS, increasing effort and schedule.  
Summary  Not Recommended  
 
 
Option  4. Do Minimum - Evolve ISS 
Gather LfE to improve ISS contract to eradicate known issues and make 
more efficient. Incorporate new acquisitions to deliver against all KURs.  
SMART 
Objective  1. Contract  G This option delivers SMART objective #1.  
Critical 
Success 
Factors  Strategic Fit  G ISS i sevolved  to incorporate all DELIVERABLE  that were out of 
scope in ISS (Annex C) in order to deliver across all KURs. L fE is 
incorporated into the contract to resolve known issues within the 
ISS contract, delivering an improved s ervice to end users.  
Value for 
Money  G The competition element of this option allows for VfM to be 
delivered . Additionally, incorporating L fE allows for identified 
efficiencies to be written into the contract.   
 
An opportunity has been identified (and tested within the 
DELIVERABLE s In Service Support Contract) to evolve KPIs 
and introduce Service Credits and Incentive Payments which are 
not included in the current ISS contract.  This means that the 
contract performance can be improved.   
 
A further opportunity has been identified to restructure and reduce 
the number of L ots within ISS, which could also help to deliver 
further V fM. 
Supplier 
Capacity  G Industry engagement has taken place and i ndicates that there is 
sufficient interest to run a competition aligned to this option. The 
competition will allow for all suppliers to bid and be evaluated for 
suitability.  
Affordability  A Whilst t here is a deficit between Cost Model and Control Total, the 
framework structure of the contract means that affordability can be 
achieved.  
Achievability  A Given the timeframe  of this project, the schedule is acknowledged 
to be very tight . There are some resource gaps within the team , but 
these are currently filled with Equinox resource and task based 
resourcing support. Where SQEP is unavailable within the team to 
create new performance monitoring software, this has been 
sourced and booked from the Digital and Data Reserves team.  
Summary  Recommended  
 
 
Option  5. Re -write ISS 
Develop a completely new contract ignoring all the aspects of ISS that 
currently work well. This option creates a big risk that the work will not be 
complete prior to DATE , leaving KURs at risk of being unsupported. This 
is the riskiest and most expensive option.  
SMART 
Objective  1. Contract  R This option does not deliver SMART objective #1.  There is 
insufficient resource or time available to complete contract award by  
DATE .  Critical 
Success 
Factors  Strategic Fit  G A completely new contract delivers against all KURs. This option 
has the opportunity for KURs to be reassessed and a ‘perfect fit’ 
contract developed and delivered.  
Value for 
Money  A Given the timeframe, there will be insufficient time to run a 
meaningful competition . This option ignores the L fE that has 
already been captured and starts afresh.  
Supplier 
Capacity  A Market engagement to date has focussed on the current ISS and 
proposed structure of ISS DATE  which has been well received. A 
fully re -written contract would need to be tested with the market to 
ascertain its attractiveness.  
Affordability  A ISS is largely successful.  A full re -write would be time consuming 
and not effective use of team resources. A new cost model would 
need to be developed which carries the risk of not achieving 
affordability under the existing Control Total which is based on ISS. 
Achievability  R Fully re -writing ISS may deliver improved performance, but the 
trade -off will be achieving the contract in the timeframe necessary.  
It will therefore result in a temporary loss of operational capability 
during the period between contracts.  
Summary  Not Recommended  
 
 
Option  6. Contract For Availability  
Develop elements of the ISS contract to include contracting for 
availability, instead of using a framework agreement.  KURs are 
delivered. Cost is not controlled and there is a strong risk that the 
Control Total is breached.  
SMART 
Objective  1. Contract  A This option will require a re -write of KURs to uplift them to contract 
for availability – but this is not what the FLCs have indicated they 
require. The effort needed does not match available resource 
availability and so the contract will not be able to be  delivered by 
DATE . 
Critical 
Success 
Factors  Strategic Fit  A This option delivers against the KURs , but also risks ‘over -
delivering’ as KURs do not specify availability on a 
DELIVERABLE -by-DELIVERABLE  basis.  
Value for 
Money  R Changing operational demands require flexibility in 
DELIVERABLE  availability, however, in this option, the contract 
would be based on having ALL DELIVERABLE  available , 
meaning that NAME OF DEPARTMENT  is paying for services 
it doesn’t need . A number of DELIVERABLE  (for example,  
STAFF  DELIVERABLE s) are used on an ad -hoc basis and do 
not have true availability metrics . The Control Total is based on a 
flexible framework contract, so contracting for availability would 
result in a significant increase that is not affordable, due to the 
volume of DELIVERABLE s being maintained. This drives risk 
and hence cost into an industrial base not used to managing that 
throughput .  
Supplier 
Capacity  A There is a risk that contracting for availability becomes an ‘unknown 
risk’. Suppliers could be disinclined to bid for a contract where 
availability KPIs are non-negotiable. Conversely, suppliers may be 
more inclined to bid for a contract that guarantees throughput.  
Affordability  R The current framework contract allows for affordability decisions to 
be made on a daily, monthly and yearly basis . This option removes 
the flexibility to make decisions based on combined objectives  of 
operational need and affordability.  
Achievability  A This option is largely achievable, but  will require additional resource 
to further understand the availability that might be required – KURs 
would need to be revisited.

result of  poor performance, 
or insolvency.  Contract includes mechanism 
to terminate contract for 
variety of reasons including 
poor performance. DPQQ and 
ITN will include checks on 
solvency and ability to deliver 
contract . KPI measurement 
will indicate any decline in 
performance in time for further 
mitigating action to be put in 
place, but if a contractor 
should become unable to 
deliver the contract at short 
notice, this still presents a risk 
to capability.  
General Election    The imminent General

of committee approvals to 
achieve the schedule.  
Incomplete data

knowledge    The cost model is based on 
Cost Drivers selected by 
SQEP within the team and 
based on historic activity. 
However, historic activity is 
not necessarily an accurate 
indication of future activity.  Risk has been applied to the 
Cost Model to mitigate this 
risk. 
 
 
   Annex H – ISS DATE  Design  
Introduction  
Using LfE and the team’s considerable SQEP, market knowledge and understanding of 
operational priorities, the structure, naming convention, prioritisation and content of each 
lot was determined.  
Design of the Lot Structure  
The process began with r epresentatives from Engineering and Operations agree ing the 
content of each lot, on a quantity basis, using L fE and information held within the   DMR. 
The outputs were captured in  the   Matrix and ratified by representatives from all other 
functions (Acquisitions, Finance, Commercial, Security, and Safety) at a workshop held 
on DATE .  
It was also agreed that the following items would be incorporated into ISS DATE  Lots:  
• REDACTED  
The following will remain outside of the scope of ISS DATE : 
•   REDACTED  
Objectives  of the proposed design were captured as follows:  
• Reduction in Lots will result in reduction in administrative burden around contract 
awards  and management  
• Better distribution within lots will improve user experience  
• Lots renamed to adhere to current naming conventions (for example, removing 
reference to location and MAB details)  
• Lots put in priority order of operational importance and numbered accordingly to 
improve clarity around internal processes  
Final Lot Structure:  
1. ORGANISATION 1  
2. ORGANISATION  2 
3. CUSTOMER  
4. Overseas     
5. Work   
6. ORGANISATION 3  
7. UK Operations   
8. Support and Training   
Lot Allocation Mechanism  
Principles will apply to the Lot Allocation Mechanism based on NAME OF DEPARTMENT  
contractual requirements and replicate what worked well when awarding the ISS 
contract:  
• Contractors may bid on any number of Lots.  
• Lots will be awarded from highest (1) to lowest (10) rank.  
• Contractors cannot win a combination of Lots that exceed a percentage 50% of 
their annual turnover, without some further guarantee.   Additional principles based on L fE from ISS will apply:  
• The order of precedence has been divided into four  tiers.  
• Lots 1,2, 3 are tier 1; Lot 4 is tier 2; Lots 5, 6, 7, 8 are tier 3; and Lot 9 is tier 4.  
• Each tier attracts a different number of points (tier 1 = 10; tier 2 = 6; tier 3 = 5; tier 
4 = 1)  
• Contractors can only win one Lot in tier 1.  
• Contractors can only win Lots of a total value of 21 points.  
• Ambition: If a contractor turns down the offer of a Lot Contract, they automatically 
become ineligible to accept any alternative lots – CLS to review full tender pack 
and advise if we can use this clause.  
Contract Performance  
LfE was gathered from ISS and the In Service Support Contract ( ISS). The ISS contract 
took a novel approach to KPIs, to allow the Operations Team to use the contract more 
actively to monitor contract performance than is possible in ISS. 
KPIs for ISS DATE  are therefore divided into 3 elements  based on the ISS contract :   
• Element 1: What we want suppliers to deliver  
• Element 2: How we’ll measure the overall performance of the contract  
• Element 3: Incentivisation and Redress within the contract  
As worked well on the ISS contract, Service Credits and Incentive payments will apply to 
specific KPIs, based on contractual and agreed delivery dates.  
A further element of KPIs relates to the mandated inclusion of Social Values performance 
measures within the contract:   
• Element 4: Social Values  
Social Values will be evaluated as part of both DPQQ and ITN during contract placement 
and will be monitored under the contract as an element which is distinct from Elements 
1,2, and 3. There will not be any financial redress linked to Element 4 of the Soc ial 
Values, but this KPI will be linked to performance with associated action plans.
