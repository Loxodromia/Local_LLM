PROGRAMME NAME  : Category  X Full Business Case for a Revised 
Acquisition and Sustainment  Approval  
 
Executive Summary  
 
Approval of the PROGRAMME NAME  Full Business Case (FBC)  will enable the delivery of  a 
critical operational capability to fill a gap in defence of the UK and allies, a gap that has 
been present since the retirement of REDACTED in DATE . The delivery of PROGRAMME 
NAME  also enables  the UK to  deliver REDACTED , a commitment that  is critical to political  
and operational relationships . Additionally, c ontinued support to REDACTED  places  the UK 
in a strong diplomatic  position,  building valuable international relationships  as the UK leads 
the way with the current DELIVERABLES  baseline . 
 
The Outline Business Case (OBC)1 approved the acquisition of PROGRAMME NAME  
DELIVERABLES  to be operated from LOCATION , with an Approved Budgetary Level (ABL) 
totalling £ XXXX . Subsequently , the Integrated Review (IR) in DATE  reduced the acquisition 
to three DELIVERABLES  and changed the operating location to CUSTOMER  OTHER 
LOCATION , to take advantage of synergies with OTHER PROGRAMME , with a reduction in 
cost of  £XXXX . The PROGRAMME NAME  FBC requests approval for an updated not to 
exceed (NTE) ABL of £XXXX , comprised of £XXXX  (reduction  of £XXXX  against OBC ) for the 
revised acquisition of DELIVERABLES  and an initial su stainment  support solution  uplift of 
£XXXX  for X years , required  to be in place by DATE ; an In -Service Date (ISD) of  DATE (P70), 
Initial Operating Capability  (IOC)  of DATE , a Full Operating Capability  (FOC)  of DATE  and an 
Out of Service Date (OSD) no earlier than DATE . 
 
 
1. Issue . The PROGRAMME NAME  requires approval for : an updated ABL for acquisition 
following IR  decisions ; a Sustainment ABL for a  XX-year contract  to align with the next OTHER 
PROGRAMME  contract break, enabling efficiencies to be exploited; and approval of programme 
milestones.  
 
2. Timing.  Urgent  to support the award of the PROGRAMME NAME  sustainment contract by 
DATE  and enable  a contractor  mobili sation period ahead of ISD. 
 
Recommendations  
 
3. The Approving Authority  is invited to approve : 
 
a. A combined Acquisition and X-year Sustainment NTE ABL (outturn, inclusive of all non -
recoverable VAT at 50% confidence)  of £ (XXXX uplift of £ XXXX ), comprising : 
 
(1) £XXXX  RDEL . 
 
(2) £XXXX  CDEL . 
 
 
b. Provision of £XX FOREX risk for future costs  that are outside  of the ABL , of which 
£XXX  is the variation between the X Economics Monitor ( XEM) rates and the Corporate 
Planning Assumption (CPA) . 
 
 
   c. A revised In -Service Date (ISD) and return to operations date of DATE  (P70), driven by 
the modification and acceptance of REDACTED  #1. Programme milestone definitions are at 
Annex A. 
 
d. An Initial Operating Capability (IOC)  date of DATE driven by the provision of 
DELIVERABLES . 
 
e. A Full Operating Capability  (FOC) date of DATE  driven by  REDACTED to deliver the 
defined rate of effort  and delivery of  DELIVERABLES.  
 
4. The Approving Authority  is invited to note : 
 
a. Approval of this FBC is required no later than DATE , enabling a  XXXXX  contract for a  
DATE mobilisation . Any approval delays will reduce the mobilisation period increas ing 
delivery risk against achieving ISD  and operational output . 
 
b. The reduction in cost associated with IR scope changes is £ XX. The details are 
provided in Annex C.  
 
c. The approved  Key User Requirement s (KURs)  are at Annex D. 
 
d. The forecast Programme  benefits,  and associated Defence Strategic /Enabling 
Objectives a re at Annex E. 
 
e. The 10/50/90% confidence levels modelled for this ABL are outlined below. A

delivery schedule  by DELIVERABLE , based upon the  continuing challenges within the supply 
chain and DELIVERABLE ’s increased certification  requirements . Therefore, I would request  
that the programme ISD is approved to P 70 IMS date of DATE , which I believe represent s a 
more realistic  delivery schedule .

k. An Assessment Study to provide options and costs  for the resolution of  pan-DLOD 
issues , amplified  by the decision to base PROGRAMME NAME  at   OTHER LOCATION , will 
be conducted . The resulting actions  will be prioritised and allocated to owners  who will 
submit  business case s outside of this approval . 
 
l.   PROGRAMME  Delivery Team will be required to grow  by XX FTE to ensure 
Programme delivery . 
 
Five Case Narrative s 
 
Strategic Case  
 
5. Acquisition . The capability requirement  and urgent need  presented in the OBC and 
previous  RN remains extant.  The IR-mandated reduc tion in  PROGRAMME  PROGRAMME  can 
deliver the minimum capability required by the COUNTRY , including  the planned contribution to  ; 
however,  the volume of tasking  that can be achieved  is significantly reduced . A DELIVERABLES  
can deliver c.X% of the output when compared with the original approval for DELIVERABLE  
detailed at OBC.    has completed an assessment against the KUR threshold and objective 
measures  and have confirm ed that DELIVERABLES  can deliver the minimum capability required 
by the COUNTRY . Additionally,  a move  to   DELIVERABLES  reduction in DELIVERABLES 
numbers from nine to seven, and  a reduction in simulator devices , was required to achieve  the 
mandated savings . The relocation to LOCATION  is expected to achieve efficiency through co -
location with DELIVERABLES  (also a DELIVERABLES ). Colocation of PROGRAMME NAME  at   
DELIVERABLES alongside DELIVERABLES , also enables  significant  operational training 
opportunities  that will enhance the DELIVERABLES  effectiveness of both DELIVERABLES .  
 
6. The single  source acquisition with COMPANY NAME  is fully committed through a contract to 
deliver three DELIVERABLES  and REDACTED under a Firm Price contract . Initially,  training  will 
be delivered through an innovative combination of system  and cognitive training systems .  
 
7. Sustainment. The Sustainment solution ha s been developed since  DATE  utilising  
experience and comparisons with other COUNTRY  fixed OTHER programmes , including 
PROGRAMME NAME . The   have also engaged with SYSTEM NAME  System Programme Office  
(SPO)  at OTHER LOCATION  to learn from their experience and develop areas for co -operation . 
The OTHER Programme has benefited  significantly  from the DELIVARABLES experience , which 
includes over XX years of operational output and capability sustainment.  Since the decision  to 
relocate the DELIVERABLES to LOCATION , the s upport solution has been revised to be within the 
same contract with NAME  as PROJECT NAME  to maximise efficiencies, opportunities,  and 
coherence between the DELIVERABLES . Building on this initial co -operation and coherence, the 
near-term intent for the follow -on Pricing Period is to mature  a combined DELIVERABLES  through -
life support strategy , develop ing a joint support  system and align ing the support contract  elements , 
which will bring operational, resource and fiscal efficiency . An overview of the Sustainment solution 
is at Annex F.  
 
8. Dependen cies. The key P rogramme  dependencies  include : 
 
a. PROGRAMME NAME  Programme.  The UK PROGRAMME NAME  Pg is benefitting 
significantly from the modifications that the DELIVERABLES  is funding under the upgrade 
programme, including REDACTED  and DELIVERABLES improvements . There are no further 
costs attributable to the UK for this dependency.  
 
b. DELIVERABLE Training . The COUNTRY DELIVERABLES  personnel will provide the 
foundational  SQEP  of the future force . The COUNTRY  will remain dependent on 
REDACTED   for the ground training of the personnel allocated to the first CONTRY  
PROGRAMME NAME  Operational Conversion Unit course  with access to training until the   UK training is  in place . There are no further costs attributable to the COUNTRY  for this 
dependency.  
 
c.   (XX). XX will provide the Communications  & Information System s (outside of the    
provision ) and REDACTED to operate the DELIVERABLE . All costs to the PROGRAMME 
NAME  Programme have been factored into the Cost Model associated with this FBC.  
 
9. Future growth . Opportunities for future , spiral  development of the PROGRAMME NAME  
capability are highlighted at Annex I, which  are national choices  outside the scope of this FBC.  
MOD will continue to work closely with partners through the relationship with OTHER COUNTIRES 
to monitor, develop and drive efficiency into future upgrade options . A separate approval will be 
sought at an appropriate time should the COUNTRY  choose to join a collaborative modification 
programme . Such opportunities include:  
 
a. Follow -On PROGRAMME NAME Improvement Programme . The UK is monitoring 
the development of REDACTED.  The UK has contributed XXXX to the concept phase of this 
capability  and will continue to have access t o reports and progress through the Working 
Groups. It is possible that the capability  will be fielded with the REDACTED in the DATE XX . 
This will pre sent a significant  optional  opportunity for a UK PROGRAMME NAME  upgrade at 
an appropriate time.   
 
b. REDACTED . The REDACTED  to their DELIVERABLS . The addition of REDACTED  
will enable REDACTED  and DELIVERABLE  document sharing. The REDACTED  will 
continue to monitor development of the capability  and present a business case at an 
appropriate time.  
 
c. DELIVERABLES . Future alignment with DELIVERABLES , will bring efficienc y to both 
programmes.  Aligning with the REDACTED , managed and delivered government to 
government will likely bring financial efficiency , operational benefits around REDACTED  that 
would not be normally possible. A business case for both elements will be submitted at an 
appropriate time.  
 
Economic Case  
 
10. Acquisition Value for Money (VfM) . In the original assessment of value for money, based 
on the procur ement of  DELIVERABLES , the ‘cost per DELIVERABLE ’ was £XXXX, which 
compared well with higher costs incurred for other nations’ procurements (which ranged from 
£XXXX-£XXXX per DELIVERABLES  Reducing to DELIVERABLES  and relocating to LOCATION  
increases the acquisition cost per DELIVERABLES  to c.£XXXX. This still compares favourably 
against other customers; COUNTRY  (£XXXX), COUNTRY  (£XXXX) and COUNTRY (£XXXX). The 
most recent estimate for acquisition is XXXX for the modification of  PROGRAMME  equating to 
XXXX per DELIVERABLES . 
 
11. Sustainment Solution VfM. The PROGRAME NAME  Sustainment solution and the 
development of the cost model  has been informed by  several  specific elements; these are listed 
below : 
 
a. PROGRAMME NAME  gov-gov engagement regarding the in -service experience and 
costs.  
 
b. The PROGRAMME  Sustainment proposal with extant supply chain for technical and 
logistic support , exploiting their internal processes across the wide r supply chain , including 
commercially available catalogue prices  and DELIVERABLES spares from COMPANY  for  
specific DELIVERABLES S pares. 
 
c. DELIVERABLE  has developed a  Make or Buy Plan that outline s which of the 
sustainment services will be performed ‘in -house’ and which will be sub-contracted , including 
its rationale for these choices . Where services are to be  sub-contracted, the Make or Buy   Plan outlin es which work packages will be sourced via competition and , where compe tition is  
not viable, the rationale for direct supply is articulated  within the plan . 
 
d. In line with  the Make or Buy Plan, DELIVERABLE  is undertaking sub -contract 
competition for several elements of the sustainment  solution  spanning areas such as : 
DELIVERABLE  spares procurement and repair ; and procurement and s upport for tools, test 
equipm ent and ground equipment . These are in addition to areas previously competed and 
embedded in the OTHER PROGRAMME  A&TSP contract , to which PROGRAMME NAME  is 
being added .  
 
12. VfM is also being incorporated through exploiting DELIVERABLE  common spares with as 
well a  DELIVERABLE  as common support service  opportunities  with DELIVERABLES (e.g. 
maintenance and logistic services) . Further VfM opportunities are being realised through utilising 
wider commodity support solutions through the  DELIVERABLES . The intent  in the future is to 
expand the co-operative support elements for the ORGAISATION  PROGRAMME NAMES  
solutions to drive further opportunities and VfM. As discussions between the PROGRAME NAMES  
mature, areas for potential sustain ment co -operation and coherence will also be investigated and 
pursued. Considering these factors,  it is assessed that the current proposition represents good 
VfM. 
 
13. Price . As outlined  in para 19 ,  REDACTED  are undertaking an Allowable Cost Review (ACR) 
of the PROGRAMME NAME  Sustainment proposal , and their analysis and output will inform the 
DELIVERABLES  negotiating position prior to contract award. The scope of the ACR will include  
Prime contractor costs , major COUNTRY  sub-contractors and elements of COUNTRY  costs. In 
addition, the  DT has utilised the COUNTRY  Financial Information  Services  (FIS)  to audit 
DELIVERABLE Defence COUNTRY  (XXX) costs and the DELIVERABLE  Management  Agency  
(DCMA) will audit the DELIVERABLE  costs  on receipt of the final proposal . PROGRAMME NAME 
(PWC) ha s also support ed the PROGRAMME in assessing efficiencies and opportunities , which 
has inform ed the DT’s negotiation strategy . 
 
14. The PROGRAMME NAME  programme FYXXXX  sustainment budget  has been provided gov -
gov and indicate s a cost of ~£ XXXx for FY XXX, whereas to  COUNTRY  costs, estimated from  
PROGRAMME s Drop 2 proposal , will be  £XXXX-£XXXX/yr at steady state . Both the COUNTRY  
sustainment solution s have the same core elements, scope and are largely driven by fixed costs 
(hence the COUNTRY  solution is not XX% of the COUNTRY cost) and scheduled maintenance . 
The   sustainment  solution  is a X-year contract  and whilst it supports a DELIVERABLE , it was last 
signed  within a different economic climate than today. This pr ovides an indication of cost and VfM 
for the COUNTRY  sustainment cost, that will be further analysed and used to support DT contract 
negotiat ions as outlined above. The intent is to finali se negotiations in Q4 XX with contract award 
by DATE XXXX . 
 
15. FOREX . The PROGRAMME NAME  Sustainment contract amendment will be priced and 
paid in a combination of COUNTRIES . This approach is considered best value for money, 
compared to the likely cost of industry holding the exchange rate risk in the current economic 
climate.  
 
 
 
 
Commercial Case  
 
16. Sustainment Procurement and Commercial Strategy . The procurement strategy for 
PROGRAMME NAME Sustainment is to place a single -source amendment to the extant 
DELIVERABLES and Training Support Provider (A&TSP) contract  with PROGRAMME . This will  
create a framework that will enable the progressive implementation of an integrated 
PROGRAMMES  support solution. The initial priced period of performance for PROGRAMME 
NAME  sustainment  services will be X years, comprising a X-month mobilisation period and X years 
of execution of su stainmen t services , which will align with the next PROGRAMME  support contract   break point.  This period will be sufficient to inform the pricing of the next pricing period and will 
ensure that future PROGRAMME NAMES  pricing periods are harmonised, thereby enhancing the 
Department 's commercial leverage.  
 
17. The procurement is excluded from the Defence and Security Public Contract Regulations 
2011 (DSPCR) under Regulation 7(1)(a) due to the requirement for the provider to access 
nationally sensitive information. This exclusion was authorised by the Directorate  of Security and 
Resilience in DATE . The single source justification , which has been endorsed by MOD Legal 
Advisors , is based on technical reasons and intellectual property rights (IPR) restrictions ; a 
Voluntary Transparency Notice was published in DATE XX X without challenge . Contract 
negotiations are ongoing and are expected to conclude in Q3 YR XXX , ahead of a contract award 
in DATE XXX . A comprehensive  Commercial Strategy has been developed ; this is summarised at 
Annex K. 
 
18. Supply Chain . DELIVERABLE  will be the Prime contractor responsible for delivery of all 
contracted elements of the PROGRAMME NAME . DELIVERABLE  is currently providing a similar 
service scope for PROGRAMME  under the DELIVERABLE  contract  (noting that  PROGRAMME 
has a larger FMS element than  PROGRAMME ), with no reported performance issues. 
Approximately XX% of the contract (by value)  will be subcontracted by DELIVERABLE  either to 
other DELIVERABLES  entities in the COUNTRIES , or to third-party suppliers .  
 
19. Performance  and Incentivisation . PROGRAMME NAMES will have a standalone 
performance management regime, with KPIs measuring the outputs of the key levers of availability: 
scheduled maintenance output, unscheduled spares provision, training, technical services, and 
system availability. All KPIs will be lin ked to performance deductions of up to XX% of the 
contractor’s baseline profit , utilising combinations of temporary and permanent  deductions.  An 
incentive adjustment of up to X% of the total allowable costs may be included, subject to 
agreement of an appro priate, measurable performance enhancement . 
 
20. Pricing Strategy . The contract will contain a pricing mechanism that demonstrably 
represents best V fM. The price for Pricing Period 1 (PP1) remains an outstanding item for 
negotiation . It is anticipated that the X-month mobilisation period will be firm priced  and t he price 
for the service delivery phase will be informed by an analysis of uncertainty and risk that is 
currently being undertaken with the support of   Cost Engineers , Defence Economics , and the 
NAME  Contract Management Agency ( XCMA ). The A&TSP contract is a QDC and, therefore, 
prices will be agreed in accordance with the Single Source Contracting Regulations (SSCR)  and 
statutory  guidance on Allowable C osts.   
 
21. Limitation of Contractor’s Liability . The contract will not  require COMPANY NAME  to 
accept uncapped liability and will provide  caps  against the five Heads of Loss defined by MOD 
policy . This approach is not expected to create any new contingent liabilities for the Department  
(noting the XXXXX contract has two reported contingent liabilities relating to pre-approved 
indemnities) . 
 
22. Social Value . The sustainment contract will include measurable outcomes relating to the 
delivery of social value against the themes in the Social Value Model identified as being most 
relevant to the Programme : tackling economic inequality, fighting climate change and equal 
opportunity.  The agreed metrics for PP1 will measur e DELIVERABLES s contributions in several  
areas that are designed to create social value in and around the OTHER LOCATION  area. These 
typically include outreach work in local education establishments (e.g., careers fairs, pre -
employment workshops, etc.), providing work experience and apprenticeship placements and 
working with local authorities to support environmental campai gns. 
 
Financial Case  
23. Against PCR 2 -DATE  the programme is unaffordable in total cost and profile. The total increase 
is driven principally by the addition of Management Adjustment for Realism (£ XX), the procurement 
of a spare DELIVERABLE , previously articulated as a Risk Outside Costing (£ XX), the addition of   DELIVERABLES  support (£ XX) and additional technical infrastructure regulatory compliance (£ XX). 
Profile changes have been driven by a delay to DELIVERABLES delivery, which has impacted the 
requirement for the initial provisioning of spares and ground support equipment which moves £ XX 
from FY XXXX  into XXXX.  The P9 and S9 affordability  position against PCR 2-DATE  is outlined 
below . Costings are based on Annual Budgetary Cycle (ABC) YRXX CPAs.  
 
 
 
 
Table 3.  PROGRAMME NAME Cost Summary . 
 
24. The affordability profile presented in Table 3 reflects a Not  to Exceed (NTE) basis of costing . 
Options have been generated to reduc e PCR 2 -DATE cost growth , the detail s of which are at 
Annex C Table 3 . Consequently, it is anticipated that  PCR 1 -DATE  will see an overall reduction in 
cost. Due to the political imperative reflected in the Defence Plan , and a s a priority programme 
within CUSTOMER have accepted the pressure and have agreed to provide the SRO with a CT to 
cover the programme cost . 
 
25. Since Contract award in  DATE XXX  to DATE XXXX , the main acquisition contract has sunk 
costs of £ XXXXX , with a further £ XXXX sunk on technical infrastructure. Remaining costs to 
deliver the remainder of the Acquisition Programme of Record are £ XXXX and £ XXXX for technical 
infrastructure.  
 
26. The ABL has been calculated using Defence Economics FOREX Monitor Rates f or DAT E. 
Comparison with the costs presented for affordability which have been calculated using the  
ABCXX   Corporate Planning Assumptions, identifies a USD exchange rate volatility of -£XXXX; 
this will be mitigated centrally through budget rebalancing measures in accordance with current 
finance instructions . 
 
Management Case  
27. Governance, Approvals & Assurance. The PROGRAMME NAME  Programme is classified 
as a Category ‘ X’ investment and falls under D efence Major Projects Portfolio (DMPP)  and 
Government Major Projects Portfolio (GMPP) . The Integrated Approvals and Assurance plan 
(IAAP) and the Specific Evidence Table  (SET) has been endorsed by Strategic Finance Investment 
Approvals (SFIA ) and Scrutiny respectively  and demonstrates that the programme  continues to  
engage in all mandated Governance , Approvals and Assurance activities including  Programme 
Boards,  Assessment Gates and Information notes . The PROGRAMME NAME  Programme 
adheres to the  Project Management Control Framework (PMCF)  and a ll mandated  programme 
artefacts  required  are referenced in the Programme  Definition Document  (PDD) .  
28. Milestone Delivery Confidence . The key Capability Milestones  of ISD, IOC and FOC  are 
driven by c onfirmation of DELIVERABLES  estimated delivery dates  (EDD) of P10, P50 & P90 as 
deter mined  by the Schedule Risk Analysis (SRA) . The Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) has 
incorporated the Pan-DLOD  delivery outputs  based on ‘most likely’ dates and P50 date for 
DELIVERABLES  as agreed by Assurance and Scrutiny Communities.  A Schedule Narrative and 
Plan on a Page (POAP)  level 0 & 1 Schedule displaying timelines of all DLODs  key deliverables  is 
displayed  in Anne x B. DLoD Strategies and output  requirements for ISD, IOC and FOC are also 
displayed  Annex L. However,  concerns remain over COMPANY ’s ability to  deliver  against the  
schedule, based upon the continuing challenges within the supply chain and DELIVERABLE ’s 
increased certification requirements  and hence the request for  acceptance of the  IMS P90 ISD of 
DATE XXXX . 
29. Management Plans . The PROGRAMME NAME  Programme has a variety of Management 
Plans to ensure delivery of programme milestones , captured in Annex  M. 
30. Risk Management . Programme and DLOD -level risks are managed via SYSTEMS  risk 
register where all high -level risks are assigned a risk owner and appropriate risk mitigations. Risks,   Assumptions, Dependencies, Issues & Opportunities (RAIDO) Working Groups  with all DLODs  are 
held regularly . All Programme Risks are discussed at Programme Boards.  A Risk Complexity 
Assessment RCA has been completed  highlighting top risk s across the DLODs  and Programme . A 
list of top p rogramme risks, issues  and mitigations are captured at Annex N. 
Top-5 Programme Risks  
a. Funding insufficient to support IOC & FOC sustainment req uirements  - Signifi cant 
delays to the approval of this FBC or rejection will render the  PROGRAMME DELIVERABLE  
unsupportable  requiring storage , care and maintenance  or disposal.  
b. Security Accreditation - Failure to gain security assurance ( REF). The complexity of 
security requirements across the Programme delays ISD  as the capability can’t be accredited 
through traditional methods or  accepted under Secure by Design.  
c. Impact on operational output due to insufficient Profession Workforce levels ( REF). 
Insufficient recruitment across the professions  results in the inability to complete tasking or 
the engineering support to the DELIVERABLE . 
 
d. Unable to meet national and operational commitments due to late DELIVERABLE  
delivery .  Unexpected emergence of risk delays the ISD of the PROGRAMME , extending the 
gap in its contribution to REDACTED . 
 
e. Insufficient trained personnel to achieve operational Programme milestones ( REF). 
Delays within the equipment project s result in a delay to REDACTED  against IOC and FOC 
requirements.  
  
31. Learning from experience  (LFE). The PROGRAMME NAME  Programme adheres to the 
LFE Strateg y. Lessons learn ed on the Programme are pushed  to the wider portfolio via the LFE 
register.  An PROGRAME NAME  Log captures Lessons Identified pulled from other sources and 
that have  been utilised  on the Programme . The ongoing plan of promoting  LFE culture  across the 
Programme  is detailed in the TLMP . The XXXX  Project Evaluation Plan also provides an 
assessment plan to Identify Lessons.  The top -lessons Identified are detailed at Annex P. 
32. Presentation and Handling . The PROGRAMME NAME Programme priority is to return to 
delivering   operations under the extant Memorandum of Understanding , written for REDACTED . 
The politic interest in withdrawing the UK’s contribution in kind, vice a financial contribution  to 
funding, continues to intensify as the Programme delays. However, REDACTED , the UK has 
experience and opportunities to offer.  
33. Delays to  PROGRAMME NAME  ISD. The reasons for PROGRAMME NAME  Programme 
delays and the impact to UK Defence has also gained significant interest, particularly during the 
recent House of Commons Defence Committee review into REDACTED . Delays  are not 
attributable to a single contributing factor but  a combination of  parts supply , availability of skilled   
technician s due to the rejuvenation of the sector , and the increased certification activity  required 
across the industry post -DELIVERABLE  Max incidents . The MOD is working closely with 
DELIVERABLE  to find opportunities within the modification schedule, including DELIVERABLE ’s 
incentivisation of the supply chain, bonus payments to retain the skilled workforce and parallel 
activity through certification to drive efficiency.  The MOD’s Firm Price contract with COMPANY 
NAME  will continue to hold leverage , as the costs associated with any delays will be absorbed by 
COMPANY NAME  until completion.  
34. For example , a result of the forecast late delivery of the first DELIVERABLES , there will be a 
significant impact on COMPANY NAME ’s cashflow position as the MOD will defer payment of 
XXXX  until associated programme milestones are achieved. COMPANY NAME  has also lost the 
opportunity to earn an incentive payment of up to XXXX  that would have been payable if the first 
DELIVERABLES  was delivered before the contracted delivery date.    35.   Agreement .  The Programme name  relationship with COUNTRY  and COUNTRY continues 
to strengthen, with a Vision Statement for the nations signed in DATE . The intent of the Vision 
Statement is to drive  capability development, operational efficiency, and global sustainment  of the 
platform, working together as a single voice to DELIVERABLE  and peripheral suppliers. The UK 
Programme remains in a strong position due to its modern PROGRAMME NAME baseline that the 
COUNTRY will build upon . The strength within this relationship has the potential to provide 
continued influence  over the development of the capability, access to COUNTRY  training and 
testing ranges and  support from the nations in times of conflict . 
36. UK Defence Industrial Resilience . The forecast DELIVERABLE  Industrial Resilience 
benefits associated with the PROGRAMME NAME  Programme are at Annex J. The 
PROGRAMME NAME l Programme is expected to create X new enduring, highly skilled jobs in the 
UK, with around X of these already created under the acquisition and infrastructure projects. Of 
these additional jobs, COMPANY NAME  expects an extra X jobs to be created in direct support to 
UK PROGRAMME NAME . In the longer term, the aim is to grow the UK industrial base in support 
of PROGRAMME NAME  and OTHER PROGRAMME  Programmes, including options for Depth 
maintenance within the UK, potential support to the PROGRAMME  Programme and other global 
customers as they co mmit to the capability in future years.

1. Schedul ing Approach.  The PROGRAMME  PROGRAMME NAME  Programme  Level 0 
Integrated Master Schedule (IMS)  has been created using  three inputs; a DELIVERABLE  provided 
deterministic schedule that has not been subject to risk analysis , a DELIVERY Schedule Risk 
Analysis  (SRA) output  (equipment and logistics only) and the wider DLoD deterministic deliverable  
dates .  
 
a. DELIVERABLE  Schedule . The DELIVERABLE  equipment delivery schedule has only 
been subject to limited risk analysis and remains largely deterministic. Confidence has built 
up to the submission of this FBC  through detailed hours monitoring  for the modification 
activity, a transparent approach to risk  management  and through consistent schedule 
stabilisation.  
 
b. DELIVERY   SRA . The DELIVERY SRA provided the P10, P50 and P90 dates for the 
equipment delivery programme and logistics elements of the IMS. The risk analysis of the 
DELIVERABLE  Schedule has further provided assurance to the deterministic dates provided , 
and a solid foundation on which to place the DLoD deliverable activities. The DELIVERY   
SRA identified DELIVERABLE  modification and delivery, and certification activity as the 
critical path items.  
 
c. IMS. The IMS is a hybrid pan -DLoD schedule built upon the DELIVERY SRA and the 
DLoD deterministic deliverable activities.  It identifies  three capability milestones : ISD, IOC  
and FOC , incorporat ing the pan -DLoD Level  2/3 activities  and linked dependencies . Due to 
the availability of  scheduling tools and resource within CUSTOMER , an SRA has only been 
carried out on the DELIVERY   activities, all other DLOD activities are deterministic  based on 
expert  knowledge and experience . Progra mme level risks have  also been  considered and  
factored into the durations  to present a level of realism .  
 
d. Critical Path. The critical path activities associated with the PROGRAMME  
PROGRAMME NAME  are covered in para 3(d-f) in the PROGRAMME NAME  FBC.  
 
2. Schedule Assurance . Assurance of the IMS has similarly been layered at each stage to 
provide  confidence in the resultant IMS dates.  The approach has been  agreed with the Scrutiny 
and Approvals teams.  
 
a. DELIVERY SRA . The SRA has been subject to Monte Carlo assessment  to provide a 
level of confid ence  to the application of risk based on probability  of occurrence  and impact to 
the Programme.   
 
b. IMS. The IMS has been subject to review by an independent scheduling expert within 
the Air Capability Portfolio Office. They have reviewed the final schedule for modelling errors 
and checked the output to provide assurance to the final dates.  A collaborative arrangement 
with the DELIVERY   team has also provided a valuable cross -check to ensure errors in IMS 
calculations are rectified prior to the submission of this FBC.  
 
3. Nuances . The REDACTED activities have been included in the IMS but extend beyond  ISD. 
The issue will be mitigated using  a DELIVERABLE  (Development) .

analysed using the CAAS FOREX Assessment tool.  
3. The -£XXXX  FOREX variation shown above between the DEM rates and the Corporate 
Planning Assumption (CPA) rate is included in the ABL. This is the potential cost variation 
attributable to exchange rate volatility.

prior to contract award and may lead to changes in DELs. RMC has not been defined at this stage 
and will be assessed and updated during Sustainment contract finali sation.  
5. Write -Off due to Programme of Record Change . With the reduction in scope of the 
PROGRAMME  capability in FY DATES  post the Defence Integrated Review  (IR), the deposits paid 
for those two   £XXXX, along with £ XXXX of Infra costs for work done prior to the decision to move 
the PROGRAMME  were written off.   Also, in F YXX/XX additional infra costs totalling £ XXXX were 
also written off.   Once the acquisition contract is complete, a review of the final costs will be 
undertaken to assess if there are any further write offs due to the Programme of Record changes.  
6. Reduction in Cost Explanation . The Programme is predict ing reduction in costs of circa 
£XXXX from the IR decision, which is broken down as follows:  
m. Acquisition cost reductions of £ XXXX. This included the removal of 
DELIVERABLE S from the programme , and a reduction in spares procurement costs 
achieved through using assets already produced for the DELIVERABLE to offset planned 
initial provisioning procurement.  
n. Infrastructure savings of £ XXXX . This is made up of a saving of £ XXXX in 
infrastructure build costs through the decision to co -locate the DELIVERABLE  with the   
OTHER PROGRAMME  at  , which removed the need for REDACTED  and allowed co -share 
of LOCATION . Secondly, DELIVERABLE  had agreed to contribute £ XXXX to the 
construction of the  LOCATION  in return for being able to generate third -party revenue for 
the company through the use of REDACTED  from other customers. While this will now be 
needed for PROGRAMME  maintenance, MOD negotiated an agreement with DELIVERABLE  
which recognised that the alignment of PROGRAMME  and maintenance contracts would 
generate additional revenue for the company, and in return DELIVERABLE  agreed to honour 
its original £ XX contribution.  
o. Predicted Sustainment cost reductions of £ XX out to DATE XXX . These are 
modelled costs as the sustainment element of the Programme had always intended to be 
covered within this Full Business Case.  
7. As of  DATE XX , the PXX% confidence of the DELIVEABLE  ISD has been identified a s DATE 
XX. This is  when the sustainment contract needs to be ready to support an DELIVERABLE  and 
provide critical associated services . The delays  due to the DELIVERABLE B uild programme has 
realised £XX of further cost reductions  from the original  sustainment contract  period  out to  DATE 
XXX. When  combined with costs of an additional £XX for an DELIVERABLE  engine , a cost of £ XX 
for modelled cost inflation out to the end of the first sustainment period and modelled inflation cost 
of £XX out to YR XXX  (to align with IR and years 1 to 9 of ABC XX), a total forecast cost reduction 
of £XXX is achieved  against the programme.  
 
 
   Table 1 . Revised sustainment contract  cost reductions after PPST YR XXX  published position.  
 
 
8.  The Acquisition ABL  Journey . The OBC excluded sustainment and only approved the 
acquisition of DELIVERABLE , with an Approved Budgetary Level (ABL) totalling £ XXXX. The IR 
decision to reduce to DELIVERABLE  and co -locate the DELIVERABLES  at   with OTHER 
PROGRAMME  realised significant cost reductions  along with DELIVERABLE  missing 
incentivisation payments  for delays in DELIVERABLE modification. Increases in FOREX and 
inflation over the period added significant cost into the programme that had to be absorbed. This 
concluded with a YRXX  PPST position  of £XXXX. Since DATE XX , changes in scope ha ve 
reduced  costs  by £XXXX, but regulatory compliance changes and FOREX incurred  £XXXX of 
additional costs. This results in an updated acquisition ABL for DELIVERABLE  of £XXXX and the 
requested sustainment ABL of £XXXX. Combined, the Total FBC  approval is requested at £ XXXX, 
with sunk costs to DATE XX  stand ing at £XXXX.

 Annex  F – Sustainment Solution Overview  
 
1. Requirements Development . The PROGRAMME  Sustainment requirements were initially 
developed in DATE  by exploiting a wide range of inputs and these have continued to be reviewed 
and matured since that time. The initial PROGRAMME  baseline Statement of Requirement (SoR) 
was produced using the   Support  SoR that was developed by the DT, and with COMPANY  
consultancy support . Support requirements, LFE and inputs from other programmes have also 
been incorporated, as well as LFE/experience from multiple discussions with the PROGRAMME  
System Programme Offi ce (SPO) in COUNTRY . Additionally, numerous workshops took place 
from DATES  between the PROGRAMME    DELIVERABLE , ROLE  , REDACTED  and COMPANY 
NAME  to review and mature the SoR. In DATE  the PROGRAMME  DT released a Request for 
Proposal that incorporated the PROGRAMME  SoR to COMPANY NAME  to develop REDACTED.    
Support contract Periods of Performance (PoP) ( X + X-year periods). The PoP for the initial 
contract has subsequently been agreed by DELIVERY   and COMPANY NAME , and endorsed by 
the ROLE , to be XXX years as described in the FBC Commercial Case and Commercial and 
Procurement Strategy.  Reducing the PoP to X reduces the risk and un certainty in the COMPANY 
NAME  price  due to the global economic situation.  This PoP  facilitates a mobilisation period, 
followed by in service operations to gather support , performance,  and output evidence to inform 
follow -on Pricing Periods and VfM assessment . 
 
2. DATE Integrated Review Impact on Solution . The outcome of the Defence Integrated 
Review in DATE led to a Programme of Record (PoR) change for the PROGRAMME  
DELIVERABLES  to be reduced from 5 to 3 DELIVERABLE  and relocated to  LOCATION  with the   
DELIVERABLES . As part of the PROGRAMME  Senior Leadership Review (SLR) work to address 
the PoR changes and savings required from the Programme, a 2* Heads of Agreement (HoA) was 
signed by MOD and DELIVERABLE  that underpinned the revised acquisition, infrastructure and 
sustainment programmes scope, strategy, assumptions/dependencies, and Estimated Maximum 
Prices. The HoA UK Sustainment solution costing was derived by DELIVERABLE  from analysing 
and reading -across actual costs from the  COMPANY /  PROGRAMME  programme when 
considered against the scope/scale of a UK solution. Although the HoA is a non -legally and 
commercially binding document, it provides the framework for the development of the 
PROGRAMME  solution and contract. The PoR and HoA strategy and costing was also based on 
the PROGRAMME  Sustainment solution being incorporated under the extant   ASP/TSP support  
contract, with COMPANY NAME  as the single source Prime to the OSD. Having PROGRAMME  
and REDACTED  under a single support  contract with the same Prime contractor enabled 
significant opportunities and efficiencies to be developed and realised. The impact of the IR and 
PoR changes were incorporated into the PROGRAMME  SoR and the Commercial and 
Procurement Strategy.  
 
3. Solution Development . When the PROGRAMME  Outline Business Case and initial 
acquisition contract were being developed and staffed in DATE , the intent was to exploit the 
knowledge and experience the SPO had with the PROGRAMME  capability and their in -service 
support  solution. The COUNTRY  solution was Primed with DELIVEALB LE Defence COUNTRY  
and the UK’s intent was to develop a similar Sustainment model for the UK, Primed by COMPANY 
NAME . This would exploit the experience, develop commonalities to enable future co -operation 
between the UK and COUNTRY  and also allow the programme to proceed at pace to meet the 
operational requirement for the capability as outlined in the PROGRAMME  OBC. Since DATE  the 
concepts and basis for the PROGRAMME  Sustainment solution have continued to be matured, 
including after the release of the RfP in DATE  and prior to COMPANY NAME ’s submission of their 
Drop 1 Sustainment Proposal in DATE . The solution development  has also assessed and 
incorporated opportunities with   at   and with COMPANY NAME  as detailed below.  
 
4. COMPANY NAME  Sustainment Proposals . Since the release of the PROGRAMME  DT’s 
Sustainment RfP in DATE , well over 100 joint technical and commercial workshops have been 
undertaken by the PROGRAMME  DT with COMPANY NAME  to mature the understanding of the 
SoR, as well as to develop the solution and COMPANY NAME ’s Statement of Work. This work led 
to an initial Drop 1 Proposal from COMPANY NAME  in DATE ; however, due to the impact of   
 COVID and the global economic situation on materiel, resources and DEIVERABLE  and their sub -
contractors, COMPANY NAME ’s proposal was non -contractable and contained large areas of 
ROM estimates and assumptions on support  solution SoW/scope. To address this, further joint 
work to mature the solution and review Drop 1 with the PROGRAMME  DT was undertaken , leading 
to a revised Drop 2 Proposal on DATE , and a final contractable proposal delivered in DATE . 
COMPANY NAME  is repricing the Drop 3 proposal between DATES  to reflect the latest 
PROGRAMME  programme  assumptions and requirements , ahead of final contract negotiation in 
Q3 DATE . The intent, as described in the Commercial Case and Commercial/Procurement 
Strategy, is for contract award in DATE . 
 
5. Sustainment Solution Scope & Opportunities with  . The PROGRAMME  solution  is for a 
combined  REDACTED , with PROGRAMME  Sustainment services with COMPANY NAME  
incorporated in the ASP/TSP contract for expanded support  at OTHER LOCATION  for 
PROGRAMME , as well as reach -back into wider COMPANY NAME , DELIVERABLE  and sub -
contractor support . The scope of the COMPANY NAME  Sustainment solution is broken into 
REDACTED.  In addition, the solution also s upports  training , as well as the GSS, systems and 
software s upport  and development. In the Sustainment contract the COMPANY NAME  SoW 
describes the outputs of all the Service Lines and is supplemented by a Solution Description 
Document that provides further detail on how each of the Service Line outputs is produced and 
delivered. Each of the Service Lines is described below, along w ith how opportunities and 
efficiencies with  are  being realised.  
 
6. Base Maintenance .  COMPANY NAME  is already delivering a Base maintenance service at   
LOCATION for  scheduled maintenance. This service will be expanded to incorporate 
PROGRAMME  Base scheduled maintenance, which will allow COMPANY NAME  to exploit 
REDACTED . The strategy for provision of PROGRAMME  and maintenance ( X and X yearly deep 
maintenance for PROGRAMME ) is being developed as a joint project by both DTs, which  is 
looking to leverage economies of scale of a joint PROGRAMME  solution. The funding requirement 
for PROGRAMME  DELIVERABLE is included within this FBC and costing  covering the 
requirements up to DATE  for this initial Po P. 
7. Technical Services –  DELIVERABLE . COMPANY NAME  is the Co -ordinating Design 
Authority for PROGRAMME .  The DELIVEARBLES Authority resides within the PROGRAMME  DT, 
along with Crown Servant Engineering Authorities. Consequently, DELIVERABLE  will be 
contracted and responsible as the CDO under the Sustainment contract to provide post design 
services for DELIVERABLES worthiness, safety and engineering technical support  and advice to 
the UK PROGRAMME  programme, including maintaining the design records, technical queries, 
modifications, AD/SBs etc. The scope also encompasses reliability analysis, maintenance reviews, 
fault investigations, health/usage monitoring and integrity mgt. COMPANY NAME  will act as the 
lead for the provision and co -ordinati on of Technical Services, including DELIVERALBLES Field 
Service Reps at LOCATION  and technical support  reach back  to the DELIVERABLE  COUNTRY  
CDO and OEMs/sub -contractors such as COMPANY  and CFMI. As part of future evolution of the 
service, with the agreement of the PROGRAMME  DT TAA as the strategy matures, COMPANY 
NAME  is looking to take on Design responsibilities and privileges for the GSS and potentially areas 
for the REDACTED  in future contract periods . 
8. Technical Services – Continuing DELIVERABLES worthiness . Continuing 
DELIVERABLES worthiness Mgt (CAM) of the in -service PROGRAMME  DELIVERABLES  is the 
responsibility of the ROLE  CAM at LOCATION . The postholder has responsibility for both 
PROGRAMME  and  DELIVERABLES . COMPANY NAME  provides CAM Support  Services 
(CAMSS) to the Mil CAM thought the ASP contract as part of a joint CAM. The COMPANY NAME    
CAMSS will be expanded to include PROGRAMME , providing the Mil CAM with COMPANY NAME  
resources for both DELIVERABLES s within the joint CAM .  
9. Supply Chain M anagemen t. There is a COMPANY NAME  logistic team at CUSTOMER  
OTHER LOCATION  that provides spares and repairs services and s upport  to, alongside their 
CUSTOMER  logistic counterparts in the  LOCATION  and other facilities at CUSTOMER  OTHER   
 LOCATION . The COMPANY NAME  SCM team act as the focal point for reach -back into wider 
DELIVERABLE  SCM spares procurement and repair services with other DELIVERABLE S, OEMs 
and subcontractors. The logistic solution is continuing to evolve as a joint enterprise and will be 
expanded to include PROGRAMME  through the single s uppor t contract. PROGRAMME   will 
exploit cost reduction opportunities for a joint SCM service with COMPANY NAME , as well as for 
common DELIVERABLE  spares, as well as in other items such as engines, gearboxes and APUs. 
Analysis has already been undertaken to assess common DELIVERABLE  Green spares that has 
informed the PROGRAMME  Initial Procurement spares orders during DATE  and for DATE . 
COMPANY NAME  will provide logistic support  for PROGRAMME  DELIVERABLE  Green spares, 
PROGRAMME  system spares, GSS devices, the OFT, and trainer. PROGRAMME  will utilize 
standard MOD logistic IS IT tools such as REDACTED  for inventory m anagemen t and accounting.  
 
10. Training .   classroom and synthetic device tr ainin g delivery for STAFF  are CUSTOMER -led 
and supported by COMPANY NAME  resource through the Training Support Provider ( TSP) 
element of the   suppor t contract. ROLE  and ROLE  have decided that PROGRAMME  training will 
also deliver ed through this CUSTOMER -led approach initially to exploit coherence and ensure that 
existing tr aining  delivery is not adversely affected. Consequently, for PROGRAMME , COMPANY 
NAME  will provide instructors and t raining  support  resources to meet the CUSTOMER ’s 
requirements and be part of a joint tr aining  resource at CUSTOMER  OTHER LOCATION  delivering 
classroom and synthetic tr aining . During the initial PROGRAMME  contract PoP, further analysis 
will be undertaken to consider whether a n alternative tr ainin g model with a DELIVERABLE  led 
output -based training service for PROGRAMME  and   is VfM and effective in meeting the future 
training  requirements of the CUSTOMER ; this industry -led training  service model is what is 
currently in place for the with  COMPANY  in COUNTRY . Maintenance and s upport  of the UK’s 
OFT and  trainer synthetic devices is covered by the Systems Service Line below.  
 
11. Systems . The Systems Service Line for PROGRAMME  covers the maintenance and s upport  
of the GSS, including the OFT and synthetic tr aining  devices. The GSS encompasses the 
development and test labs for software for the PROGRAMME  system by COMPANY NAME , as 
well as reach -back into OEM s such as COMPANY  and COMPANY  for hardware and software 
support  for systems respectively through the COMPANY  SCM service. S upport also includes other 
key equipment such as the Deployable S uppor t System.  
 
12. Another vital component of the Systems Service Line is the development, testing and release 
of system software In Service Builds (ISBs). Building on years of ISB experience within   
COMPANY  and the  /SPO for the PROGRAMME A, COMPANY  is looking to exploit the experience 
and processes used by  COMPANY  to read -across for the UK. The UK ISBs will follow a X-year 
development cycle, leading to a rolling annual release with ISBs overlapping. When the 
DELIVERABLE enters service the acquisition programme software buil ds for the DELIVERABLES  
will still be ongoing though to delivery of the DELIVERABLES  in Q1 YR XXX . As a consequence, 
COMPANY  is looking at the best approach to develop the initial UK ISBs pending procurement and 
delivery of GSS labs/equipment to CUSTOMER  OTHER LOCATION .  The strategy is likely to 
continue to exploit the DELIVERABLE  acquisition software build resources and facilities at  
LOCATION  for ISBs #1 and #2. This ISB/GSS strategy is currently being developed and agreed 
between the PROGRAMME  DT and COMPANY NAME . 
 
13. REDACTED . PROGRAMME  is developing and introducing REDACTED  as the primary tool 
for managing and recording maintenance, component life tracking and clearing the 
DERLIVERABLES . REDACTED  is widely used for MOD DELIVERABLES  and it is managed via a 
DELIVERY contract with COMPANY NAME . The development and introduction of REDACTED  for 
PROGRAMME  is part of the Acquisition programme, with through life support  and maintenance of 
the application covered under Sustainment. REDACTED  is essential to support  safe operation of 
the and to maintain DELIVERABLES worthiness.  
 
14. Other Support Opportunities  and Efficiencies . The PROGRAMME  Sustainment solution 
incorporates common equipment suppor t arrangements for equipment with the APS DT, as well as 
DELIVERABLES with the DELIVERABLES  Commodities DT. The range and scope of   
 PROGRAMME  Sustainment s upport with the commodity DTs will continue to evolve and expand 
as in -service experience is gained. The PROGRAMME  DT and COMPANY NAME  is also exploring 
with ORGANISATION where ORGANISATION ’s capabilities and capacity could s upport  
PROGRAMME  in-service requirements.  
 
15. International PROGRAMME  Support. PROGRAMME  is currently operated by 
COUNTR IES. In s uppor t of those customers, an international Sustainment WG with 
DELIVERA BLE has been running for several years with the aim of identifying common s upport  
issues that the  nations can co -operate on such as obsolescence, in -service 
reliability/maintainability, and common issues. The UK has been an observer in that forum for the 
past few years and will become a full member once the DELIVERABLE  Sustainment contract is 
placed. The COUNTRY  also joined the Sus tainment  WG in DATE as an observer with the 
announcement of the PROGRAMME  Programme.  
 
16. In addition, the UK has been working closely with COUNTRY  since circa DATE  on the UK  
programme  to develop areas for co -operation, gather LFE for the UK and to jointly develop further 
co-operation for the future. Now that the COUNTRY  is also procuring an PROGRAMME  capability,   
discussions have started with a view to develop and implement co -operation for the capability and 
sustainment.  
 
17. Sustainment Service Performance  and Outputs . The intent for PROGRAMME  
Sustainment contract is to develop an output -based performance regime that will be focussed on 
delivering and improving supportability and availability for the PROGRAMME  capability and 
training  system. The Sustainment RfP proposed KPIs based on this approach for the  
 
18.  System, Tech Services , Training , SCM and MRO Service Lines, with an Incentive 
Adjustment offering up to 2% of allowable costs based on delivery of a measurable performance 
enhancement above the contracted baseline. This performance approach for PROGRAMME  is an 
enhancement on where   has started with their KPIs and negotiations with COMPANY NAME  are 
ongoing to push them to move to such an approach for PROGRAMME , drawing on   COMPANY ’s 
and  /SPO’s year’s PROGRAMME  experience.  
 
19. For follow -on PoPs the aim is to continue to evolve the performance approach and KPIs for 
both PROGRAMME  and   as part of a Support System and under the common contract. The near -
term intent is to create an overarching combined  Through -Life Support Strategy and to develop a 
joint Support System and align the associated COMPANY NAME  support  contract. The intent is 
also for the two DTs to merge  common roles  and responsibilities in due course to drive forward co -
operation, coherence and VfM. Analysis of support and cost data, as well as LFE from the   and 
initial PROGRAMME  PoPs, will be utilized to inform and shape the scope, outputs , and cost of 
future PoPs. The intent is to enhance the synergies and coherence between PROGRAMME  and  , 
focussed on continuing to measure and improve the tr aining  and capability outputs. This approach 
will then lead to updated IAC approvals via RNs for each Price Period and contract award post 
negotiation subject to demonstration of VfM . 
 
   
 Annex G  – Acquisition Update  
1. Programme Background . The PROGRAMME NAME Programme  was launched after 
SDSR  DATE  in recognition of the pressing need to invest and improve the  DERLIVARABLES   
Management capability to keep pace with existing threats and evolve to match future 
developments.  
 
2. Analysis of the options during the CSP Concept phase focussed on REDACTED . These 
options were presented in th e CSP Operational Analysis Supporting Paper to the Joint 
Requirements Oversig ht Committee (JROC) and MOD Scrutiny in DATE  and both found the case 
for procurement of a new platform compelling when judged against the requirement and from a 
cost effectiveness perspective.  
 
3. In DATE , a Strategic Outline Case (SOC) was submitted to the Investment Approvals 
Committee (IAC) in line with the MOD’s Approach to Investment Decisions (MAID) project. The 
SOC detailed why the DELIVERABLE  PROGRAMME NAME  was considered the only solution 
that c ould meet the UK’s required PROGRAMME NAME in a timeline and risk envelope 
consistent with the urgent need. It was therefore requested that approval be granted to proceed 
to the Outline Business Case (OBC) on the assumption of a sole source procuremen t of the 
DELIVERABLE  PROGRAMME NAME  Mk1. To support the SOC, an Accounting Officer (AO) 
assessment was produced to demonstrate that the programme me t the four standards expected 
by Parliament and the public for use of public resources; regularity, propriety, Value for Money 
(VfM) and feasibility.  
 
4. In DATE XX , authority was granted by Chief Secretary Treasury (CST) and the IAC for CSP 
to engage in single source discussions with DELIVERABLE5 and a Request for Proposal (RfP) 
was issued to the company in DATE XX . This and subsequent negotiations enabled the 
programme to develop the Outline Business Case (OBC)6 for submission in DATE XX/ . HMT 
granted approval to proceed DATE XXXX as per the Outline Business Case. An initial contract for 
the DELIVERABLES  Segment was signed DATE XX . 
 
5. In early DATE the Secretary of State for Defence directed the PROGRAMME  team to 
commence negotiations with DELIVERABLE  to descope the PROGRAMME  PROGRAMME 
NAME  programme in order to deliver significant fiscal savings under the title of the 
PROGRAMME  Senior Leadership Review (SLR). The outcome of these negotiations w ere 
formalised through a non -binding, Heads of Agreement (HoA) between the parties that was 
signed on DATE . This document set out the principal terms and conditions that would be agreed, 
subject to Authority approvals, and provided detail regarding the amendment of e xisting contracts 
and new contractual arrangements that would be entered into within the agreed PCT 
(performance, cost, time) envelope.  
 
6. This was formalised in DATE XX  with submission of a Review Note to the IAC on DATE XX  
that recommended that a reduction of the DELIVERABLES  size and a number of other 
efficiencies, including a change of basing location to CUSTOMER  OTHER LOCATION  that would 
save over £ XXXX from the first XXXX yrs of the programme. The RN also noted that a further 
reduction would make further savings. DELIVERABLE  had advised that a decision on the 
reduction by the end of DATE XX  would maximise savings due to there being another customer 
for the DELIVERABLE  that would have been converted into the PROGRAMME NAME . An 
Outletter was issued by the IAC on DATE XX  that allowed the DT to issue a contractual change 
notice to DELIVERABLE  that was subsequently formalised in DATE XX . The implementation of 
the change in DELIVE RABLES was delayed  and negotiations were only concluded in  DATE XX 
with the contract amendment implemented in DATE . 
 
 
 
   
 7. Acquisition Contract . Since initial signature, there have been Thirteen  amendments to the 
acquisition contract, as follows:  
 
REDACTED

Economic Case  
 
2. The case made by Reference B remains valid with REDACTED.  
 
Commercial Case  
 
3. The PROGRAMME NAME  infrastructure commercial strategy draws from lessons learnt from 
the original LOCATION  project. A two -stage plan was followed with COMPANY NAME ; a X-month 
Enabling Works contract awarded on DATE XX  followed by a XX-month Main Construction 
contract awarded on DATE XX . The Main contract is a Qualifying Defence Contract let under the 
Single Source Contracting Regulations and was subject to sub -contract competition.  
 
4. COMPANY NAME  have agreed a comprehensive Social Value clause which is flowed down 
to COMPANY,  the main sub -contractor. Lessons learnt will be shared with Commercial Policy.  
 
Financial Case  
 
5. Reference C approved £ XXXX for PROGRAMME NAME  infrastructure; the endorsed 
Review Note, at Reference A, noted an expected value of £XXXX for PROGRAMME NAME  
Technical Infrastructure at CUSTOMER  OTHER LOCATION . Since Reference D, rising inflation 
within the construction industry has increased costs significantly. The Main Construction contract 
with COMPANY NAME  was Firm Priced ; additional costs  required for design changes  have been 
implemented , most notably  for the increased security requirements for SAP accreditation . 
DELIVERY   expects VAT to be ratified as 3.8% for all infrastructure costs  due to shared (with 
COMPANY NAME ) occupancy of the facilities . It should be noted that PROGRAMME  Technical 
Infrastructure  sustainment  (Hard and Soft Facilities Management)  is included within the 
ORGANISATIONS contracts and associated approval s. 
 
Management Case  
 
6. Whilst the timescale to deliver the infra solution remains short, high confidence exists that the 
schedule is achievable due to the robust contract in place. The contract identifies 8 sections with 
50% of the commercial delay damages focused on REDACTED due to the importance to the 
capability of this milestone. The Sectional Completion dates are as follows:  
 
Section  Title Completion Date

   Annex I – PROGRAMME NAME  Capability Roadmap  
 
    Annex J – DLIEVERABLE  UK Prosperity Graphic  
 
   Annex K – Commercial Strategy Overview  
 
Introduction  
 
1. The PROGRAMME NAME  Commercial Strategy provides a comprehensive plan of how the  
PROGRAMME NAME Sustainment requirement will be procured and managed through -life. This 
Executive Summary outlines the key aspects of the strategy. All of the issues discussed below are 
covered in more depth within the main body of the Commercial Strategy.  
 
Requirement  
 
2. The proposed prime contract is for the provision of PROGRAMME NAME  Sustainment 
services. Contracted support will be provided across the following seven service lines (SL):  
 
• Training (SL2)  
• Technical Services (SL3)  
• Support (SL4)  
• Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (SL5)  
• Supply Support (SL6)  
• Programme Management (SL7)  
• Security (SL8)  
 
Procurement Strategy  
 
3. The Procurement Strategy is a non -competitive procurement for both the support and training 
solution, with COMPANY NAME  as the prime contractor. Other options were discounted based on  
technical know -how and access to intellectual property that could not be sourced from a third party 
without exposing the Department to an unacceptable level of risk.  
 
4. Although the requirement would ordinarily fall within the scope of DSPCR DATE , it is excluded 
on grounds of security of information under Regulation 7(1)(a). Advice from MOD Legal Advisors 
(MOD LA) was obtained regarding this approach, and the application of the exclusion has been 
endorsed by the Directorate of Security and Resilie nce (DSR). The procurement is subject to the 
provisions of the Single Source Contract Regulations DATE (SSCR).  
 
Commercial Model  
 
5. The contractual vehicle for the delivery of the PROGRAMME NAME  sustainment requirements 
will be the OTHER PROGRAMME  DELIVERABLES  and Training Support Provider (A&TSP) 
contract, which was awarded in DATE . This pan -platform contracting strategy is expected to deliver 
long term efficiencies through co -location at CUSTOMER  OTHER LOCATION , an aligned support 
arrangement and a joint contract, which should give the Department greater commercial leverage.  
 
6. The expiry date of the A&TSP framework is DATE , which aligns with the planned OSD of 
OTHER PROGRAMME . The duration of the PROGRAMME NAME  sustainment contract line items 
(CLINs) will run from DATE  to the planned PROGRAMME NAME  OSD of DATE . 
 
7. PROGRAMME NAME  sustainment requirements will be added to the contract via a contract 
amendment. This pan -platform contracting strategy is the optimal approach, as it provides 
opportunities to deliver long term efficiencies through co -location at CUSTOMER  OTHER 
LOCATION , an aligned support arrangement and a joint contract.  
 
Route to Contract  
 
8. An RFP was issued to COMPANY NAME  in DATE , with proposal submission deadline of 
DATE . This deadline was subsequently extended to DATE . The COMPANY NAME  proposal 
submission was received in DATE , however, because of  the immaturity of COMPANY NAME ’s   pricing, it was agreed that two further incremental updates (“Drops”) to the proposal were required. 
These were submitted in DATES  respectively. As a result of delays to the REDACTED  delivery 
schedule the target award date has moved to the right significantly, which has had the effect of 
reducing the duration of the initial contract period (see below). Consequently, a final, updated 
proposal submission is due no later than DATE . Contract award is anticipated, subject to approvals, 
by DATE.  
 
Market Analysis and Supplier Capability  
 
9. COMPANY NAME  will be the prime contractor responsible for the delivery of an integrated 
support service across the seven service lines outlined at paragraph 2, above. COMPANY NAME  is 
currently providing similar services to OTHER PROGRAMME  under the A&TSP contract and 
therefore have an established capability to fulfil the PROGRAMME NAME  requirement. Furthermore, 
COMPANY NAME  can reach back into its COUNTRY  and COUNTRY  entities, who have been 
providing sustainment services to other customers (most notably the INDUSTRY ) for over X years.  
 
10. Although COMPANY NAME  are the prime contractor, and much of the work will be undertaken 
within the UK (mostly at CUSTOMER  OTHER LOCATION ), a significant amount of work will be sub -
contracted to COMPANY NAME  to third -party suppliers and other DELIVERABLE  entities in 
COUNTRY  and COUNTRY . COMPANY NAME , with support from the DT, has developed a detailed 
Make or Buy Plan, which articulates its sourcing strategy for each work package withing the 
overarching work breakdown structure.  
 
Contract Duration  
 
11. The A&TSP contract will provide a framework that will enable the progressive implementation 
of an integrated OTHER PROGRAMME /PROGRAMME NAME  support solution through discrete 
pricing periods of approximately X years. Requirements for future pricing periods will be 
progressively added to the A&TSP contract via future amendments, which shall be subject to 
progressive allowable cost and value for money reviews.  
 
12. The revised end date of PP1 will be set at DATE XX , as this is considered to be an adequate 
length to enable learning and data gathering, which will be used to inform prices for the following 
pricing period(s). This revised duration also provides the opportunity to align the pricing periods for 
OTHER PROGRAMME  and PROGRAMME NAME  at the earliest opportunity to enable the 
exploitation of cross -platform synergies and a potential transition to REDACTED . 
 
13. Based on the current REDACTED  delivery schedule and Sustainment route to contract plan, 
PP1 for PROGRAMME NAME  will have a duration of X years and X months, from DATE XX  until 
DATE XX . The first X months of the initial period will comprise contractor mobilisation activities, with 
commencement of service provision expected on acceptance of the first PROGRAMME NAME  
DELIVERABLE  from DATE XX . 
 
Contract Terms and Conditions  
 
14. The A&TSP contract, providing DELIVERABLES and training support for OTHER 
PROGRAMME , is comprised of three defined Parts (A -C). The OTHER PROGRAMME  
DELIVERABLES and training line items of the contract are standalone, largely operating as separate 
services under a single contract. The contract contains common terms applicable to both services 
under Part A, along with specific service terms and Statements of Work in  Parts B and C. The 
PROGRAMME NAME  sustainment amendment will establish a Part D, covering OTHE R 
PROGRAMME -specific service terms and Statement of Work.  
 
15. The A&TSP contract terms and conditions comprise a blend of DEFCONs and bespoke 
narrative terms. The PROGRAMME NAME  sustainment amendment will require amendments to the 
existing Part A terms to ensure these reflect a joint OTHER PROGRAMME /PROGRAMME NAME  
support contract. These changes are not anticipated to materially alter the balance of risk between   MOD and industry. Service -specific terms for PROGRAMME NAME  sustainment will be included in 
Part D and are currently subject to negotiation with COMPANY NAME . 
 
Price and Payment  
 
16. The price for PP1 remains an outstanding item for negotiation. It is anticipated that the X-month 
mobilisation period will be firm priced. The price for the service delivery phase will be informed by 
an analysis of uncertainty and risk that is currently being undertaken with the support of  REDACTED , 
Defence Economics and DCMA.  
 
17. The contract prices are currently subject to negotiation, with the final iteration of COMPANY 
NAME ’s proposal due in DATE XX . The A&TSP contract is a QDC, therefore the amendment will be 
priced in accordance with the SSCR. An Allowable Cost Review (ACR) has been undertaken by (  
REDACTED ) on a progressive basis in line with the incremental submission of the COMPANY NAME  
proposal. The allowable cost report was submitted in DATE , although some  REDACTED  support 
will be required following the receipt of COMPANY  NAME ’s final proposal submission. In addition to 
the  REDACTED  review, the DT has also tasked REDACTED  and COUNTRY  Financial Investigation 
Services (FIS) to audit the COUNTRY  and COUNTRY  costs. The output of the three cost audits has 
informed the DT’s negotiation strategy.  
 
18. The agreed price will be based on REDACTED .  
 
19. Prices will be in mixed currencies, comprising a mix of CURRENCY  elements. This approach 
is considered the optimal VFM solution, as compared to paying a high premium for COMPANY 
NAME  to hold the exchange rate risk in the current economic climate. Payments will be made 
monthly in arrears via CP&F, with performance deductions and incentive payments applied on a 
quarterly basis.  
 
Performance and Incentivisation  
 
20. The contract performance regime will provide a balance of financial remedies for poor 
performance and incentive payments where COMPANY NAME  exceed the contract performance 
thresholds.  
 
21. The contract will include four (4) KPIs, measuring COMPANY NAME ’s outputs against the 
main levers of availability:  
 
a) Training . Measurement of the “availability” of each training asset (including COMPANY 
NAME  instructors) through an assessment of the outcome of each training session. Training 
Session outcomes are not an indicator of whether students passed/failed any training, rather 
an indication of whether the device and/or person “performed”.  
 
b) Unscheduled Spares Provision . Measurement of the timely provision of spares in 
response to customer demands. Late delivery calculation is based on no. of days late, rather 
than a binary pass/fail calculation – this should incentivise COMPANY NAME  to expedite late 
deliveries to mitigate KPI impact. Weighting applied to high priority demands.  
 
c) DELIVERABLES Maintenance . Measurement of adherence to agreed maintenance 
output dates. Calculation based on no. of days late (as above).  
 
d) Technical Services . Measurement of adherence to agreed turnaround times for 
technical queries. Calculation based on no. of days late (as above) with a weighting applied to 
high-priority queries.  
 
   22. Remedies for KPI performance are profit deductions up to the baseline profit value (BPR is 
currently XX% = c.£ XXXX). Actual deductions will be determined on a sliding scale and include a 
mix of permanent and temporary deductions.  
 
23. The contract will also provide an opportunity for COMPANY NAME  to earn an Incentive 
Adjustment of (IA) up to 2% of the total allowable costs, during the service delivery phase. IA 
payments will be based on additional performance metrics measuring consistently high KPI 
performance (i.e., above the contract baseline) a nd PROGRAMME NAME  success.  
 
Termination and Exit  
 
24. Standard termination provisions, including DEFCON X are included within the A&TSP contract. 
The contract also includes a bespoke narrative clause providing writes to terminate for Material 
Breach and poor performance.  
 
25. The exit strategy is limited, due to the reliance on DELIVERABLE  and COMPANY  intellectual 
property and technical know -how to support the capability. Some service elements, such as training, 
common commercial spares,  and engine support, could theoretically be sourced from elsewhere if 
the need arose.  
 
Limitation of Contractor’s Liability and Indemnities  
 
26. The contract does not require industry to accept uncapped liability. The amendment to A&TSP 
will align the contract with current LOCL policy (noting that the current policy came into force after 
the contract was agreed), providing caps on the contractor’s liability against the five Heads of Loss 
(HoL) defined in the policy. The risk assessment is complete, and caps have been proposed to 
COMPANY NAME  against each HoL. The DT is awaiting COMPANY NAME  acceptance, however 
this is not expected to create any new contingent liabilities for the Department.  
 
27. The A&TSP contract has two existing, reported Contingent Liabilities relating to the use of 
HMT -approved indemnities (DEFCONs X and X).  
 
Intelle ctual Property Rights (IPR)  
 
28. It is not considered that the contract will develop any significant new IP, however bespoke IPR 
clauses are under negotiation with support from DIPR. Clauses will, where applicable, follow those 
principles agreed for OTHER PROGRAMME  under A&TSP, and will provide sufficient rights for 
international collaboration and provide security of supply in the event of early exit or termination.  
 
Social Value  
 
29. The contract will include measurable outcomes relating to the delivery of Social Value against 
the themes in the Social Value Model identified as being most relevant to the programme – tackling 
economic inequality, fighting climate change and equal opportu nity. 
 
30. The agreed metrics for PP1 are input metrics measuring COMPANY NAME ’s contributions in 
a number of  areas that are designed to create social value in and around the OTHER LOCATION  
area. These typically include outreach work in local education establishments (e.g., careers fairs, 
pre-employment workshops, etc.), providing work experience and apprenticeship placements and 
working with local authorities to support environmental campai gns. 
 
31. The DT will work with COMPANY NAME  to progressively mature the Social Value offering 
throughout the contract term, with the aim of moving towards a more outcome -focussed range of 
metrics from PP2.  
 
 
   Contract Management  
 
32. An amendment to the extant A&TSP Contract Management Plan (CMP) is currently being 
developed by the team. The structure of the CMP will mirror the contract structure, providing specific 
OTHER PROGRAMME  and PROGRAMME NAME  sections in addition to a common, overarching 
section. The CMP will provide a framework to enable staff managing the contract – across all 
functions – to understand the key underlying contract processes and responsibilities, as well as the 
softer skills a nd techniques needed to successfully  manage the relationship with industry.  
 
   Annex L – DLoD Strategies  
 
1. Training &  . 
 
a. Training. A through -life training solution for PROGRAMME NAME   Mk1 is assessed as 
deliverable. The training delivery will include DELIVERABLE  contracted support, on a 
workforce substitution model initially, with other options such as transition to a contractor 
managed service or other arrangement to be assessed at contract renewal points in the 
future. Workforce substitution brings alignment wi th the OTHER PROGRAMME  training 
model currently in use at CUSTOMER  OTHER LOCATION  which will allow for the greatest  
possible synergies and sharing of best practice. Following the decision to co -locate OTHER 
PROGRAMME  and PROGRAMME NAME  at CUSTOMER  OTHER LOCATION , the 
CUSTOMER  training unit will be combined under a single DELIVERABLE . 
 
b.  The CUSTOMER ’s PROGRAMME NAME  Mk1 will be located at CUSTOMER  OTHER 
LOCATION  and, REDACTED.  
 
c. Integrated Master Schedule. The PROGRAMME NAME  IMS is aligned with the 
Training & DLoD Strategy. The DLoD level risks have been considered to present a 
deterministic schedule that the Training & Organization DLoD owner is confident in 
achieving . 
 
2. Equipment.  
 
a. DELIVERABLES  Certification  & Safety. The approach to DELIVERABLES  
management is described in the PROGRAMME NAME   Mk1 DELIVERABLES Strategy, 
which has been approved by Director   Support. The approach makes maximum use of 
evidence generated in support of previous PROGRAMME NAME  programmes for other 
Nations, as well as the baseline DELIVERABLE  DELIVERABLES  but adapted as necessary 
to reflect the UK PROGRAMME NAME  configuration and usage. UK -specific artefacts will be 
produced where they are necessary to achieve compliance with UK pol icy, regulation and 
legislation. The  Certification Strategy adheres to REDACTED.  The Certification Programme 
has been derived through a structured Part A/B review process in line with REDACTED.  The      
Certification Exposition will claim credit for previous DELIVERABLE  and PROGRAMME 
NAME  certification activity performed by REDACTED.  The PROGRAMME NAME  Chief 
Engineer is accountable for the implementation of an effective Safety Management System 
and this is detailed in the PROGRAMME NAME  Mk1 Delivery Team Safety & Environmental 
Management Plan, which has been endorsed by stakeholders at the PROGRAMME NAME  
Safety & Environmental Panel.  
 
b. Acceptance Strategy. An Integrated Test & Evaluation Plan (ITEAP) has been 
developed for the Programme. This recognises that the UK PROGRAMME NAME  has been 
procured as a predominantly off the shelf capability and many of the system requirements 
are envisaged to have been previously verified for other programmes, supplier led T&E effort 
pre-delivery will therefore focus on the integration of configur ation changes and regression 
test of inherent capabilities. A period of follow -on T&E will be required after d elivery to refine 
the performance of the PROGRAMME NAME , develop operational procedures and gather 
evidence for satisfaction of capability requirements. This is expected to include a period 
where each PROGRAMME NAME  will be deployed to the COUNTRY  and/or COUNTRY . 
 
c. Technology Management. The following sub -paragraphs outline the process that the 
UK intends to take with regard to the development of the PROGRAMME NAME  capability.  
 
(1) Product Line Capability. The PROGRAMME NAME  capability as initially offered 
to the UK consists predominantly mature and fielded technology taken from a 
combination of REDACTED  to COUNTR IES. These will be complemented by several 
updates that have been developed for the upgrade programme.      
(2) UK Modifications / Capability Tailoring. The UK also specified specific 
modifications and additions to the baseline to allow the KURs to be met.  
 
(3) Collaborative Development. Since the OBC, the UK has REDACTED.   
 
d. Comparison with PROGRAMME A PROGRAMME NAME . Since the UK commenced 
its PROGRAMME NAME  acquisition, activity to develop new capabilities has continued in 
parallel. Recently REDACTED.  
 
3. Personnel.  
 
a.   Command Personnel. Since the signing of the OBC, basing alterations, workforce 
rationalisation and outcomes of the IR, in DATE , have required a re -baselining of the 
workforce strategy due to the now obsolete Personnel Strategy. The workforce requirement 
has been defined against the Key User Requirements and Key Capability Requirements to 
achieve programme milestones.  The Personn el DLoD will  REDACTE D.  
 
b. DELIVERY   Personnel. The PROGRAMME NAME  DT has a resource loaded 
schedule for the PROGRAMME NAME  Programme that covers capability acquisition, 
infrastructure and development of the sustainment solution and FBC. Utilising the internal 
DELIVERY   Functional Managers, the DT has been growing since the OBC approval aligned 
with the programme and the schedule. CUSTOMER  resources within the DT are defined in 
the CASP agreement with the SRO. To address resource recruitment shortfalls and 
specialist skills requirements, the DT utilizes the DELIVERY  Engineering, Project and 
Commercial Delivery Partners (EDP, PDP, CDP) where practical and affordable to do so, as 
well as DELIVERY   Internal Technical Services. For the in -service phase post Sustainment 
contr act award, the PROGRAMME  DT is developing a new resource loaded schedule 
aligned with the Sustainment FBC approval and sustainment requirements that will run in 
parallel to the extant acquisition resource loaded schedule. Work also continues with the DT 
to develop the future mode l and roles/responsibilities across the DTs, looking to exploit 
synergies and opportunities as part of a support system across the capabilities.  
 
c. Integrated Master Schedule. The PROGRAMME NAME  IMS is aligned with the 
Personnel Strategy. The DLoD level risks have been considered to present a deterministic 
schedule that the Personnel DLoD owner can provide  workforce li ability, aligned with Career 
Management continuing to identify the associated workforce against current policy.   
 
4. Infrastructure. The Infrastructure DLoD is split into Technical and Domestic provision.  
 
a. As a result of the Integrated Review, a Review Note endorsed by an Outlet ter changed 
the REDACTED.   
 
b. Integrated Master Schedule. The PROGRAMME NAME  IMS is aligned with the 
Infrastructure Strategy. The DLoD level risks have been considered to present a 
deterministic schedule that the Infrastructure DLOD owner is confident in achieving.  
 
5. Doctrine & Concepts. The current CONEMP (dated DATE ) provides the context for the 
employment of DELIVERABLE .  This document pre -dates the selection of the PROGRAMME 
NAME  Mk1 and as such will be updated prior to ISD. The CONEMP has been further explored and 
expanded upon within the PROGRAMME NAM E Mk1 CONUSE V2.0 which provides a greater 
level of detail on the PROGRAMME NAME  system and the supporting DLoDs. In the next X 
months, the D&C DLoD will oversee the creation of PROGRAMME NAME  specific Group Staff 
Orders (GASOs) and a Tactics Manual.  
   a.      Integrated Master Schedule . The PROGRAMME NAME  IMS is aligned with the 
Doctrine & Concepts Strategy. The DLoD level risks have been considered to present a 
deterministic schedule that the Doctrine & Concepts DLoD owner is confident in achieving.  
 
6. Information.  
 
a. Digital Enablement.  The Information DLoD owner (   CUSTOMER  Digital) is 
responsible for ensuring that the DLoD deliverers’ outputs for the Programme, meets time 
and quality requirements, and that reporting is complete and accurate.   CUSTOMER  will 
provide a level of assurance to the SRO that the information aspects of the capability are fit 
for purpose. The Programme has REDACTED.   DELIVERY will be given the means, and 
financial resources to enable fulfilment of the equipment and support related Information 
requirements. A Lead Delivery Owner (LDO) has been assigned to deliver REDACTED , 
working with the Programme Information Requirements Manager and the CUSTOMER  Team 
as necessary.  
 
b. Cyber Security.  The Information DLoD is responsible for ensuring that PROGRAMME 
NAME  is cyber compliant. This includes providing assurance that the platform and supporting 
systems are Secure by Design assured and JSP X compliant. REDACTED.  
 
c. Integrated Master Schedule.  The PROGRAMME NAME  IMS is aligned with the 
Information Strategy. The Information DLoD level risks have been considered to present a 
deterministic schedule that the information DLOD owner is confident in achieving.  
 
7. Logistics. The Logs DLoD plans to deliver an assured, sustainable support solution to meet 
the requirements of the PROGRAMME NAME  Programme, with the main DELIVERABLE  
sustainment contract developed and awarded through the PROGRAMME NAME  DT in DELIVERY  
. REDACTED.  
  
a. Support Strategy . The intention for the UK PROGRAMME NAME  DELIVERABLES  is 
to develop an output -based sustainment solution linking the industry support to the delivery 
of operational outputs. The PROGRAMME NAME  support strategy, CUSTOMER ’s 
requirements and DELIVERABLE  solution have matured significantly from the initial DATE  
ROM proposal from DELIVERABLE , leading to an updated COMPANY NAME  proposal that 
was delivered in DATE  that is currently being matured and negotiated with the 
PROGRAMME NAME  DT for contract award in DATE . Additionally, REDACTED.  
 
b. Integrated Master Schedule.  The PROGRAMME NAME  IMS is aligned with the 
Logistics Strategy. The Logistic level risks have been considered to present a deterministic 
schedule that the Logistic DLoD owner is confident in achieving.  
 
8. Security. The Security Function is responsible for the provision of advice and support to 
enhance coherence of security measures across all DLoDs, to ensure that capabilities are 
protected against threats from terrorism, espionage, subversion, sabotage or organised crime, as 
well as against loss or unauthorised disclosure of information. Security is assured for this platform 
through REDACTED  who is responsible to the SRO for ensuring all elements of Security have 
been considered and dealt with appropriately . REDACTED . 
 
a. Integrated Master Schedule.  The PROGRAMME NAME  IMS is aligned with the 
Security Strategy. The Security level risks have been considered to present a deterministic 
schedule that the Security owner is confident in achieving . 
   Annex  M – Management Plans  
 
1. PROGRAMME  Delivery Team . The PROGRAMME  DT has a resource loaded schedule for 
the OPEX for  acquisition, infra and long lead activities approv ed in the OBC.  This is the basis for 
the Breakdown Structure and recruitment of DELIVERY   personnel against the programme . A new 
separate  resource loaded schedule is being developed for the Sustainment approval and In -
Service Phase that will run in parallel to the acquisition schedule and OPEX resourcing. The new 
Sustainment schedule will be reviewed  against the DELIVERY  Project Controls scheduling process 
and health checks during its development. It will be  endorsed and  live prior to the Sustainment 
contract award planned for DATE . 
 
2. External Resource  - Industry . As part of their HR recruitment and skills growth, COMPANY 
NAME  has continued their engagement with  the marketplace  to proactively manage  their resource 
growth to meet the support  requirements for the PROGRAMME  Sustainment programme. This is 
building on the work they have already done for the PROGRAMME  acquisition  programme with the 
LOCATION  DELIVERABLE modification work  and sub -contractors supporting PROGRAMME  
acquisition. Additionally, the PROGRAMME  Sustainment solution will buil d on the current 
COMPANY NAME  resource s in place for OTHER PROGRAMME  at LOCATION . COMPANY 
NAME  has also continue to develop their engage ment with  local bodies in the CUSTOMER  
OTHER LOCATION  area, includ ing technical colleges , as part of their resource growth strategy for 
the area for the  OTHER PROGRAMME  and PROGRAMME NAME  programmes . 
 
3. PROGRAMME  Programm e Team . Confirmation that resource requirements for 
ORGANISA TION Personnel have been calculated effectively and that arrangements are in place to 
utilise resources effectively. REDACTED.  
 
4. Through Life Management Plan (TLMP). The TLMP  details  the approach undertaken for 
the through life support of the PROGRAMME NAME  Mk1 platform from encompassing acquisition, 
operation, in -service sustainment, capability , strategies &  plans  to its disposal.  
 
5. Transition Planning.  The Transition Plan will be overseen and directed by FHQ with the 
Business Change Manager at the centre of its progress. The original plan looked at a seamless 
transition from  PREVIOUS DELIVERABLE  to PROGRAMME NAME , the new plan focuses on the 
introduction of PROGRAMME NAME  at CUSTOMER  OTHER LOCATION  to meet operational and 
other outputs.  The OTHER LOCATION  Transition Team are the focal point for Business Change at 
CUSTOMER  OTHER LOCATION  and as such are already heavily engaged with stakeholder s and 
in the provision of integration workshops.  
 
6. Fallback Plans.  The fallback plan for the PROGRAMME NAME  Programme has in effect 
already been implemented. REDACTED . 
 
7. A mature Integrated Test Evaluation and Acceptance Plan (ITEAP)7. ITEAP  has been 
developed for REDACTED.  
 
8. Sustainability .  DELIVERY  is working closely with COMPANY NAME  to encourage 
sustainable behaviours and ensure proactive environmental management practices are integrated 
in procurement and support arrangements using  Project O riented Environmental Management 
Systems (POEMS).  The environmental sustainability approach  is detailed  in COMPANY NAME  
produced deliverables . 
 
9. Command Acquisition Support Plan (CASP). The Command Acquisition and Support Plan 
(CASP) documents the business agreement between REDACTED . A CASP is in place for the 
PROGRAMME  acquisition and infra programmes , and it also includes milestones for the 
Sustainment FBC and COMPANY NAME  contract . 
 
 
7 20240311 -E7_ITEA_Plan_v1.0 -OS   10. Support Solution . As part of developing and then managing Sustainment solutions through 
life DELIVERY utilizes the  Support Solution Development Tool (SSDT) to assess and guide DTs in 
the scope and content of their support  solutions. The SSDT evidence is assured independently , 
and a Support  Solutions Report (SSR)  produced  by a Support  Solution Officer  and a wide range of 
assurance SMEs to inform the assurance and scrutiny for BC approvals, as well as to provide 
feedback to the DT and DELIVERY   Seniors on the status of the solution against policy and 
process , and which areas need further work. The SSDT was populated with evidence and artefacts 
for assurance for the OBC approval  and has been updated  by the PROGRAMME  DT for this FBC . 
An FBC  SSR has been produced as part of the assurance activity for the Endorsement Committee  
review of the FBC . The SSDT will be updated and assessed again In Service for the LSD, IOC and 
FOC milestones.
