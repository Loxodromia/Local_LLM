 PROGRAMME  PROGRAMME REVIEW NOTE 5 (CAT X) Executive Summary  
The  PROGRAMME  programme is exploiting REDACTED. The disruptive technology will 
increase performance and reduce risk to personnel. PROGRAMME  is currently delivering   
systems, whilst also completing the Assessment Phase. Delays to the   programme means 
that a robust   Full Business Case (FBC) will not be presented until DATE . This Review Note 
seeks approval to extend the AP, start critical pat h activity and streamline delivery by 
rationalisation of  PROGRAMME  approvals. It intensifies the agile, spiral development 
approach to delivery without locking down the   solution, protecting choice for the future in a 
rapidly developing capability area.  
Issue  
Review Note 5 (RN5) is seeking approval to extend the  PROGRAMME  AP into FY  DATE & 
FY DATE , commence early   critical path activity prior to FBC and consolidate extant   
PROGRAMME  approvals into a single Approved Budgetary Limit (ABL).  
Timing  
1. Routine . The curren t PROGRAMME  Assessment Phase time approval was for years 6 -
10 which ends in DATE . Continuity of funding is required from this point into DATES  in order 
to complete the AP scope and inform the planned    
FBC, which will seek approval by DATE , as indicated in the PREVIOUS  PROGRAMME  
Information Note (Ref A).  
Recommendations  
2. The Investment Approvals Committee (IAC) is invited to approve :  
a. Uplift PROGRAMME  approval by £ XXXX  (£XXXX  CDEL, £ XXXX  RDEL, £ XXXX  
RMC, £ XXXX    PSS and £ XXXX  LOCATION  PSS) (all inclusive of non -
recoverable VAT)), for the commencement of critical path activity, as Tranche 1, 
in years DATES , to protect the capability plan.   
  
b. Extension of the  PROGRAMME  AP (due to delays with the programme), 
reprofiled in to DATES , so that the AP scope can be concluded and   learning 
from experience (LFE) can better inform the   FBC investment 
recommendations.  
    
   
 c. Consolidation of the requested uplift and extant PROGRAMM E into a single 
PROGRAMME  ABL, marking the transition to a single standardised solution .  
 
2. This will give a total revised  ABL (outturn, inclusive of all non -recoverable VAT) of 
£XXXX .   
  
3. The IAC is invited to note:   
  
a.   will remain within current AP cost ABL, as reprofiled in PCR  YEAR to align with 
delay s, and continue to deliver existing AP scope including solution definition, 
autonomy development and other trials and de -risking activity.  
  
b.   - Tranche 1 (this initial critical path scope) will utilise the requested ABL uplift to 
begin Mission System integration at a ‘System of Systems’ level, establish 
enduring training facilities, provide critical infrastructure to host  PROGRAMME  
systems and maintain other critical -path acquisition activity.  
  
c.   - Tranche 1 will also include solution development, including competition as 
appropriate, to obtain contract quality costs to inform FBC and meet the DATE  
delivery requirement.  
  
d. The PROGRAMME  candidate Key User Requirements (cKURs) are presented 
at Annex A.   
  
e. The PROGRAMME  strategic programme is summarised at Annex B.  
  
f. The transformational change that this programme is pursuing in the face of 
rapidly evolving technology and threats demands an agile, spiral development 
approach rather than a traditional waterfall approach.  
  
g. The combined PROGRAMME  sunk costs (out -turn) at AP12 DATE  are £ XXXX  
(£XXXX  AP and £ XXXX   )1. A PROGRAMME  approvals summary is at Annex C.  
h. An estimated  DELIVERY ORGANISATION  OPEX cost of £1 XXXX  and 
ORGANISATION  OPEX Cost of £ XXXX  to DATES  for all   scope. The OPEX 
provision will come out of the associated IR  DATE /ABC DATE  settlement  
i. The total equipment acquisition ROM cost estimate for the PROGRAMME    
programme is c£ XXXX  with a whole life cost over X years of c £XXXX .   is 
excluded as it is currently unfunded.  
  
Strategic Case  
4. Strategic Context.  REDACTED    
  
 
1 The current In -Year position will be made available within the progressive supporting evidence pack.    
   
 5. Requirement . Critical capability is currently provided by REDACTED.    
PROGRAMME  cKURs were presented at Initial Gate Business Case (IGBC) and remain 
stable. They have been subject to refinement through regular cKUR and User Requirement 
Document (URD) reviews, underpinned by Operational Analysis (OA), AP studies, peer 
review and colla boration with COUNTRY . Joint Requirements Oversight Committee (JROC) 
have been consulted and full committee presentation will be made prior to FBC submission.  
ORGANISATION  have  produced a supporting paper, which details the OA conducted to 
date and an overview of the OA intended to be undertaken to support FBC.  
6. Strategy . The overarching  PROGRAMME  strategy remains unchanged since 
previous approvals (Ref B) and a refreshed Programme Mandate (Ref C) has been 
endorsed by the NEC in DATE . PROGRAMME  will maintain a continued focus on the 
deployment and integration of REDACTED .  
7. The capability will be delivered using REDACTED.   The   Context Picture is at Annex 
D.   
8. Delivery Approach.  The PROGRAMME  programme will be delivered through a 
phased approach which will include three distinct procurement blocks, each building on 
previous deliverables:   
a. Delivering REDACTED  to provide an Initial Operating Capability (IOC);   
b. Subject to FBC approval, deliver ing the enduring solution by REDACTED ; and   
c. Provid ing a Full Operating Capability (FOC) but is currently unfunded and will be 
considered at IR  DATE .  
9.   PROGRAMME  is being managed as a programme, delivering capability 
incrementally through tranches of projects and the constituent projects within the 
programme are at different stages of the CADMID cycle. The PROGRAMME  has many 
VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous) characteristics.  It needs to deliver 
and sustain a viable capability as REDACTED .  Adopting Infrastructure and Projects 
Authority (IPA) best practice for a programme such as this, agile thinking and spiral 
development can better faci litate change from rapidly evolving threats and advancing 
technologies, leading to a more flexible and responsive development approach. LFE from 
the Assessment Phase and   is informing what the Minimum Viable Products will need to 
be.  
Economic Case  
10. The Economic Case presented in the  PROGRAMME  IGBC and   OBC remains 
extant.   PROGRAMME  capability will provide REDACTED .  
11. Ref A explained that DATE  was unlikely to be the optimal timing for FBC and that it 
was the intention to present a RN in DATE  for approval by  DATE . Although delays were 
partly mitigated, the first  DELIVERABLE  is not expected to be delivered until DATE , with 
final deliveries in Q4 DATE . LFE from   is already being captured and used to optimise the   
proposition.  
12. It is necessary to extend the timing of the AP, by X years, to ensure a robust   FBC, 
informed by   LFE. The AP schedule has been adjusted accordingly.    
   
 13. In parallel, it is necessary to initiate Tranche 1 now for planned critical -path activity, to 
protect the IR  DATE  capability plan and mitigate schedule risk. Further detail is contained 
within the RN5 Investment Appraisal (Ref D). The Tranche 1 deliverables are adaptable and 
flexible and do not tie the programme into a specific solution. They include:  
REDACTED  
 
Commercial Case  
14. For the RN5 scope, there are three distinct categories of commercial activity:   
a. Continuation of current Assessment Phase activities including research, trials 
and testing, procurement of a range of other enabling services and activities;  
  
b. Continuation of Operational Evaluation and any necessary enhancements & 
improvements to the existing capability based on LFE; and  
  
c. New   - Tranche 1 will be a mixture of procurement and preparatory 
commercial work undertaken by DELIVERY ORGANISATION , 
ORGANISATION  1 and ORGANISATION 2 .   
  
15. For all requirements where no extant contracts exist, competition will be the default 
route to contract.  However, given that much of the RN5 scope is a continuation of 
existing capability delivery, the route to contract is highly likely to be determined b y the 
contractual arrangements entered following previous approvals. A number of contracts 
remain extant and have Contractual Options (both funded and unfunded) to facilitate 
extension in terms of both time (for Service provision) and volume (for equipment  
provision).  All contractual arrangements will continue to fully comply (unless 
appropriate exemptions are granted) with the requirements for transparency, 
advertising and associated regulations (principally DSPCR).  
16. Where extending an existing contract, but no valid Contractual Options exist, Legal 
Advice will be sought to determine whether the existing contract can be extended by 
formal contract amendment (supported by a Voluntary Transparency Notice if 
necessary) or  whether new contract action should be pursued.  
17. Similarly, whilst Firm Pricing will be the expected norm, the full range of compliant 
pricing mechanisms will be used and deployed as appropriate, reflecting both the 
maturity of the required capability and the prevailing market dynamics.  The 
Department’s  current policy on adopting VoP for contracts over 2 years duration – or 
shorter where significant pricing fluctuations and instability precludes the agreement of 
acceptable Firm Prices – will be adhered to.   
18. Part of the  -Tranche 1 funding will enable maturation and refinement of candidate 
solutions, with a market engagement leading to contract quality costs to support the 
FBC submission.    
   
 19. Notwithstanding the fact that many aspects of work detailed above are still being 
formulated, the Commercial Strategy details the proposed routes to contract for the 
aspects of work within the stated ‘categories of commercial activity’.   
20. Procurement and commercial strategies have been produced for the RN5 scop e, 
however, the full   strategy will be addressed by the FBC, where it will also detail the 
application of Category Management and the wider interface and coherence with the 
REDACTED  Centre of Expertise – although both activities have already commenced 
and will develop during the timeframe covered by this RN.   
Financial Case  
21. The requested ABL of £ XXXX  uplift is predominantly made up of   -Tranche 1 
(£XXXX ) however, it also includes a small amount of PSS for REDACTED  (£XXXX ).  
22. The   – Tranche 1 uplift costs are based upon the  PROGRAMME  Should Cost Model’ 
which has undergone appropriate Validation & Verification. The estimated costs, including 
risk and uncertainty, are in Table 1 and a breakdown of the P50 for each of the 
subelements, is shown in Annex E:  
   Estimated Cost (£M)   
10%  50%  90%  
  - Tranche 1   £XXXX  £XXXX  £XXXX  
Table 1 –   – Tranche 1   
23. Inflation has been applied to the   cost model utilising the standard Defence 
Economics indices. Version 4.7 of the model was used to generate PROGRAMME ’s PCR2 -
DATE  inputs, which informed ABC  DATE . As this was from data frozen in DATE , the model 
has been refreshed, to reflect DATE inflation rates and risk profile, as v4.8.1. This has 
resulted in some variances between the P50 estimated costs and the provision profile in 
years 1 and 2.   
24. Affordability of   – Tranche 1 against the PCR2 -DATE  and is shown in Table 2. Noting 
that the provision includes all scope. Therefore, in FY  DATE  onwards there is an excess, 
which reflects the forecast cost for the remaining   elements not covered by RN5, which will 
be subject to FBC:

Table 2 –   PROGRAMME    – Tranche 1 - Affordability Table  
  
25. The AP reprofile and requested uplift is affordable within the provision in terms of 
volume across the ten -year period. However, there remains a low level of profiling 
issues in Year 1 and 2 in CDEL, RDEL and minor RMC. The SRO has worked with the 
Finance  
Business Partner (FBP) to identify an affordability strategy for FY DATES . The RDEL can 
be treated via the wider PROGRAMME  programme  where profiling has decreased in these 
years due to changes in the payment milestones proposed by EXTERNAL 
ORGANISATION . The CDEL can be reprioritised as a result of the latest affordability 
assessment set out in the SOC, which shows available CDEL headroom in FY DATES . The 
actual RMC consumption is difficult to forecast, but will be carefully managed within control 
total.  
26. LOCATION  PSS.   The scope and supporting cases for REDACTED  remain extant and 
this RN confirms that the PSS is within PCR2 -DATE  and detailed at Annex E.  
27. VAT. Treatment has been confirmed and will be applied at 20% for all the   Equipment . 
28. International Financial Reporting Standard.  IFRS16 has been considered as part of 
the initial procurement that this RN seeks to approve. Given the nature of the planned 
procurement, which seeks to purchase equipment and deliver to MOD sites, it is 
unlikely that IFRS16 will apply to any individual c ontact award implications arising for 
the RN5 scope.   
29. ABL Consolidation.  Combining the PROGRAMME  ABLs will mark the transition to a 
single standardised solution for   and provide a clearer overview of cost of providing   
PROGRAMME  capability. The combined  PROGRAMME  ABL, including extant 
approvals and uplift is shown in Table 3, with a more detailed summary at Annex C:   
 Assessment Phase     
Current Approved ABL  £XXXX   XXXX   
Total uplift requested by this RN  XXXX   
TOTAL ABL  £XXXX   
Sunk Costs to FY YEAR  £XXXX  £XXXX  
TOTAL SUNK COSTS  £XXXX  
  
Table 3 –   PROGRAMME  ABL Consolidation  
  
30. Accounting Policy Change.    PROGRAMME  forecasts have remained within Total 
DEL (TDEL), however an accounting policy change in FY  DATE  resulted in COMPANY  
Research & Development costs being scored to CDEL (from RDEL). This has resulted in an 
increase in the CDEL forecast of £ XXXX , offset by a decrease in RDEL of £ XXXX . The delta 
of £XXXX  is the current approval headroom against Programme forecasts as at AP0 FY  
DATE .    
   
 31. Strategic Reserve.  £XXXX  approved under the   PROGRAMME  OBC was approved 
as CDEL. An initial drawdown of £ XXXX  CDEL was utilised to cover the VAT element of 
the procurement, following a change in HMT implementation of VAT rules . The other 
emerging pressures from the Programme were predominately relating to support and 
required RDEL and inflation. Therefore, the balance of strategic reserve after CDEL 
drawdown was all converted from CDEL to RDEL funding as approved by the Senior 
Responsible Owner (SRO).  
Management Case  
32. Governance.  ORGANISATION  (NC) Top Level Budget (TLB) holder retains authority, 
but delegates responsibility to enable the   PROGRAMME  SRO NAME  to deliver this 
Programme in accordance with the ORGANISATION  Portfolio guidance, their SRO 
Appointment letter and the Defence Policy & Approvals Secretariat (DP&AS) Direction and 
Guidance for SROs13. Within  DELIVERY ORGANISATION , the programme is within the 
Director Ships Acquisition, Innovation and Future Capability Portfolio. Joint  
ORGANISATION / DELIVERY ORGANISATION  Pan-DLOD PROGRAMME  Programme and 
Delivery Boards have been established, along with other lower -level Working Groups.  
33.   PROGRAMME  Progress. Progress is summarised below, with additional context for 
the delays.   
a. Assessment Phase . The previous phase  demonstrated the significant 
potential offered by REDACTED . The current phase  is continuing to de -risk 
REDACTED  and completing a cost -effectiveness solution analysis. REDACTED.  
 
b.   (Initial Operating Capability (IOC)) .   is currently delivering REDACTED.  
Although expected to deliver within its Outline Business Case approval, delays to 
the UK/ COUNTRY  programme mean that   MS are now expected to commence 
delivery DATE  and complete by Q4 DATE  and hence why the AP now needs to be 
extended.  
 
c.  Delays.  The initial delay was primarily due to COMPANY ’s underestimation of 
the time required to resolve engineering challenges in transitioning the technology 
operationally to meet military requirements and addressing known shortfalls from the 
demonstrator contract. There have also been additional delays due t o REDACTED.  
There is no intention to rebaseline the contract again and liquidated damages are 
expected to be recovered by EXTERNAL ORGANISATION .  
34. Gateway Review.  In DATE , the Infrastructure & Projects Authority assessed delivery 
confidence as AMBER. They noted that there has been significant progress in moving 
towards an autonomous  PROGRAMME  and numerous recommendations were included in 
the report.   
35. Risk . These are managed within  DELIVERY ORGANISATION  SOFTWARE and 
subject to regular joint reviews. The principal  PROGRAMME  delivery & programme risks 
are at Annex F, with the RN5 scope providing much of the mitigation. The key risks are:  
a. Delivery - Development. There is a risk that (TIART) REDACTED.      
   
 b. Delivery - Acquisition . TIART due to the criticality of the system architecture 
and complexity the R EDACTED  may encounter manufacture, supplier or integration 
issues, leading to additional resource needed.  
c. Programme -   FBC. TIART due to difficult balance of investment decisions or 
insufficient SQEP, the FBC may be approved later than the target DATE , leading to 
delays to capability and misalignment of the funding profile.   
36. Management of Integration.  The   programme has prioritised early milestones 
relating to development of the core and is drawing on specialist support from REDACTED.   
Separate contracting of a product agnostic ‘Integrating Authority’ as part of   mission system 
delivery remains an option, as does reversion to the use of one or more prime contractors.  
The FBC will explore these options, informed by our experience of early integration work, 
will make recommendations on the proposed solution.  
  
37. Schedule. The schedule summary for the RN5 scope is at Annex G. Key milestones 
include:   
Milestone  P10  P50  P90  
Design Costs and Design   DATE  DATE  DATE  
REDACTED Delivered  DATE  DATE  DATE  
Table 4 – Milestones  
  
38. Resources.  DELIVERY ORGANISATION  and ORGANISATION  have appropriate 
Suitably Qualified & Experienced personal and resources to deliver this scope of work, subject 
to the Demand Signal continuing to be met. The current Demand Signal for the DELIVERY 
ORGANISATION    PROGRAMME  Delivery Team is for X full time equivalent (FTE) 
employees. Through the   FCR and Options Work Force Planning for ABC DATE , this demand 
signal raises to X from FY  DATE . The ORGANISATION  Programme Team has recently been 
expanded to include X x FTE Infrastructure posts to mitigate DLOD ri sks.    
  
39. Dependencies . Dependencies are captured within the Third Order Assumptions 
(3OA’s)/ REDACTED  Data Assumptions List and subject to regular pan -DLOD review at the 
Programme Board. In summary, the following responsibilities are captured in Table 5:  
Organisation  Delivery Responsibility

40. ORGANISATION  and DELIVERY ORGANISATION  have agreed an external 
communications strategy for the  PROGRAMME  Programme and jointly maintain a media   
   
 pack, including lines to take. The Directorate of Defence Communications are regularly 
updated on the programme. The ORGANISATION  Office have been consulted and the   
PROGRAMME  programme aligns with current strategy.
