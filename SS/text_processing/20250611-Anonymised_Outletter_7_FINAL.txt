1. Thank you for the PROGRAMME NAME Full Business Case at Reference A seeking approval 
for the Design and Manufacture scope of DELIVERABLE , a new Approved Budgetary Level of 
Â£XXXX .  
  
2. I acknowledge that DELIVERABLE  is vital in enabling PROGRAMME NAME  to REDACTED .  
I also recognise that DELIVERABLE  will sustain a world -leading UK technical industrial base 
and will ensure PROGRAMME NAME  is competitive in the export market.  I am aware of the 
dependency on DELIVERABLE  of the OTHER PROGRAMME .  
  
3. I am therefore content to approve paragraph 3a -f of Reference A and note paragraph 4a -k.  
Acknowledging your request for support in Government -to-Government export negotiations, I 
am keen to expedite export opportunities and will provide support as require d.  
  
4. As a condition of my approval:  
  
a. You are requested to notify the Investment Approval Commitee (IAC) of the outcome of 
REDACTED .  
  
b. Please seek opportunities to accelerate the programme delivery schedule, allowing for 
affordability and capacity factors, and inform the IAC if this happens. Similarly, please 
inform the IAC as soon as practicable should there be any schedule delay.  
  
c. Acknowledging that assured sovereign provision of ANOTHER DELIVERABLE  is critical to  
DELIVERABLE but also to wider Defence outcomes, you and your team support 
ORGANISATION  and the Directorate of Industrial Strategy and Exports in their dialogue 
with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Industrial Strategy as the latter formulate 
a strategy for ANOTHER  DELIVERABLE  supply across Government and industry.  
  
5.  After the successful Treasury Approvals Panel, HM Treasury (HMT) have approved the 
business case and have requested that the following conditions are met:   
  
a. You provide a programme Annual Information Note which should include any major inscope 
funding commitments, the timings of which are to be agreed between your team, HMT and 
DPAS.  
  
 b. By DATE, you are requested to share with HMT, via DPAS, plans for exploring 
DELIVERABLES cost sharing with PROGRAMME NAME Partner Nations.  
  
c. By DATE, please share an MOD DELIVERABLES export strategy that clearly articulates 
future export opportunities and a plan to deliver them, and share with HMT.  
  
d. Before the Demonstration contract, your wider team provides an assessment of whether 
future industry contracts could include stronger safeguards to ensure key industrial skills and 
expertise remain in the UK throughout and beyond DELIVERABLE development.  
  
e. Before the Demonstration contract please provide HMT, via DPAS, with an assessment of the 
benefit to programme delivery that supports the upfront funding commitment.  
  
f. Noting that you have significant SRO responsibilities in addition to DELIVERABLE, please 
clarify to the Defence Major Programme Portfolio Sponsor Group the proportion of your time 
that will be spent on each of the Government Major Programme Portfolio progr ammes for 
which you are responsible.  Where this is less than the best practice level of 50%, please 
provide to the Sponsor Group your plan to mitigate this shortfall by DATE.
