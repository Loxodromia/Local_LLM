PROGRAMME NAME  PROGRAMME - OUTLINE BUSINESS CASE  
  
SUMMARY  
  
Min(DP)1 endorsed the PROGRAMME NAME Strategic Outline Case (SOC) in xx DATE , which 
permitted discussions to begin with SUPPLIER  to develop a proposition regarding the single -
source procurement of the DELIVERABLE  to meet the UK’s urgent need to modernize its 
PROGRAMME NAME  capability.  A Request for Proposal (RfP) was released on xx xx DATE  
and a response received on xx xx  DATE .  It has been confirmed that with minor modifications2 
the DELIVERABLE  meets the MOD’s Key User Requirements (KURs).  Additionally, a strategy 
to demonstrate value for money (VfM) has been agreed with  SUPPLIER .  It is the assessment 
of the SRO, supported by NAME OF DEPARTMENT , that the best way to achieve VfM and 
protect early capability delivery is to proceed now with acquisition of 5 DELIVERABLE3, while 
other elements of the capability are matured ahead of the Full Business Case (FBC).  
Accordingly, a fast track opportunity exists now4 to secure DELIVERABLE S that match our 
requirements and will enable a  DATE  Initial Operating Capability (IOC).  This could be 
achieved alongside securing production slots and prices on the remaining DELIVERABLE S, 
which collectively forms the basic long -lead items.  This approach achieves better overall 
value: there is a DELIVERABLE  cost reduction when compared to production -line slots and 
the accelerated delivery enables an early withdrawal of the REDACTED  and its corresponding 
increasing maintenance costs.  By proceeding with the whole acquisition for DELIVERABLE S, 
rather t han incremental commitments with long -leads first, the MOD’s commercial position is 
protected and the risk of later cost growth is reduced. The intent is to place the acquisition 
contract for the DELIVERABLE  by end -XX DATE .  Additional long -lead activities (training, 
support and infrastructure) will also be contracted to protect this accelerated delivery, with 
the support solution to be matured ahead of a FBC in  XX DATE .  
  
RECOMMENDATIONS  
  
1. The Approving Authority is requested to approve :  
  
a. An Approved Budgetary Level (ABL) (outturn, inclusive of all non -recoverable VAT, at 
50% confidence) totalling £ X comprising:  
  
(1) £XXXX total resource consumption (RDel).  
  
(2) £XXXX capital expenditure (CDel).  
  
b. A separate provision of £ XXXX  for Foreign Exchange (FOREX) risk, based on the latest 
Defence Economics Foreign Exchange Monitor (DE FEM),5 between 70% and 50% 
confidence levels, which is outside of the ABL.   
c. A target IOC9 of DATE , subject to securing 2 DELIVERABLE s, the dependencies detailed 
at para 6, and delivering an Equipment Delivery Date (EDD) earlier than the Not -to-
Exceed (NTE) date at Sub -para 2j, allowing synchronisation with the other DLoDs.  An 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
  Information Note (IN) will be issued to update the IAC on the 50% confidence IOC plans 
in XX DATE .  
  
d. The capability scope and KURs at Annex A, as endorsed by the JROC in XX DATE .6  
  
And to note :  
  
e. The Approval break down as follows:  
  
(1) £XXXX for the acquisition of DELIVERABLE  at a Firm Price, which is the key 
outcome from this OBC along with long -lead items.  
  
(2) £XXXX for the minor modifications of the base DELIVERABLE  to meet specific UK 
requirements.  Using a mature basis of estimate drawn from previous similar 
modifications with other customers that will be Firm before contract award.  
  
(3) £XXXX for training and support long -lead elements derived from a mature basis of 
estimate using the extant   training and support solution, supplied by  SUPPLIER  
and matured through its X-years of operating experience, that will be Firm before 
contract award.  
  
(4) £XXXX for initial COUNTRIES Project Arrangements funding joint -spiral 
development of the capability at a final Firm Price to be agreed between all nations; 
this Approval does not commit to the final product but maintains UK in the design 
phase.  
  
(5) £XXXX  Equipment ( NAME OF DEPARTMENT ) risk provision.  
  
(6) £XXXX  (NTE) for infrastructure long -lead concept and requirement work, followed 
by investment in a new facility and other FLC costs (risk inclusive7).  
  
f. A FOREX variation between the DE FEM rates and the Corporate Planning Assumption 
(CPA) rate is £ XXXX  and is included in the ABL.  This is the potential cost variation 
attributable to exchange rate volatility.  
  
g. The 10%, 50% and 90% -confidence levels for costs in this OBC are as follows:  
  
Approval8  Estimated Cost (£M)  
10%  50%  90%  
Outline Business Case  
 (Acquisition, Support  & 
Infrastructure NTE)   XXXX  XXXX  XXXX   
  
h. To secure an early IOC, the acquisition will comprise of DELIVERABLE  DELIVERABLE S 
and DELIVERABLE S from the SUPPLIER  Commercial DELIVERABLE  production line.  
Consideration was given to purchasing all DELIVERABLE s as undelivered, though 
assurances could not be provided on suitable available DELIVERABLE  with appropriate 
low hours and common configuration.  Moreover, additional storage and maintenance 
costs, while awaiting modification, would erode savings.  
 
 
 
8 .     
 
  
 i. The acquisition includes minor modifications4 of the DELIVERABLE  Product Line 
DELIVERABLE  to meet UK KURs, as detailed in the Capability Roadmap at Annex B.  As 
part of this plan, the UK will be fitted with REDACTED .  A study will be undertaken to 
confirm whether this will substitute for REDACTED , which is currently out of scope for this 
programme.  
  
j. A Not -to-Exceed EDD of xx DATE .  
  
k. An EDD definition of a single DELIVERABLE , modified to meet UK requirements, 
available for use, with an appropriate Release to Service.  
  
l. The Programme Milestones at Annex C.  
  
m. Spiral -capability development will be pursued in cooperation with REDACTED .  The 
Project Arrangement covers an initial X-year period for REDACTED  development.9  This 
does not commit the MOD to the follow -on phases of these potential upgrades, which will 
be subject to a separate approval.  
  
n. CUSTOMER ORGANISATION  is assessing the most effective infrastructure solution, with 
the programme assumption for a new -build facility.  An IN will be raised ahead of the FBC 
to update the IAC on CUSTOMER ORGANISATION ’s selected infrastructure strategy and 
commitment.  
  
o. Planned submission of a FBC to the IAC in xx DATE  for the Initial Support Solution 
approval and the required additional support Non -Recurring Expenditure.  
  
p. The principal risks at Annex D, with no identified contingent liabilities.  
  
q. Estimated costs of £ XXXX  (Outturn) to the DATE  out of service, at this capability 
configuration.  This cost will be updated in the FBC.  
  
r. Sunk Concept Phase costs of £ XXXX  to end -FYDATES .  
  
s. Private Sector Support costs of £ XXXX  for the acquisition within the 50% approval.  
  
TIMING  
  
2. Priority.     CUSTOMER ORGANISATION  urgently requires a CAPABILITY  replacement, with a 
target IOC of DATE .  This is due to the evolving threat and to best align with the introduction of 
the capability.  The only way to meet such a demanding programme timeline and IOC/FOC will 
be to fast track the procurement of DELIVERABLE  and SUPPLIER  production line slots as 
soon as possible.  Moreover, any significant delay will have negative cost implications on the 
price given that the 2 DELIVERABLE  approach represents a saving of c XXXX M compared to 
the cost of new -build DELIVERABLE .  
  
STRATEGIC CASE  
  
3. Requirements.   Pan-DLoD assessment of the DELIVERABLE ’s capability against 
PROGRAMME NAME  User Requirements has been driven by Operational Analysis (OA) and is 
underpinned by a OA Supporting Paper (OASP) and a  CUSTOMER ORGANISATION  Analysis 
Paper.10  This builds on the advice presented to the IAC alongside the SOC in xx DATE , and 
 
 
    
 
  has been re -evaluated for this submission based on updated information from  SUPPLIER .  
The previous assessment, which considered that the DELIVERABLE  met all KURs at the 
threshold level, is extant with the inclusion of the modest tailoring referred to at Sub -para 1i.  
The current assessment is summarized at Annex A.   
  
4. Capability Roadmap & Future Growth Path.   Assessment of the capability of the  SUPPLIER   
Product -Line variant of the DELIVERABLE  initially offered to the UK, which differs slightly to that 
operated by REDACTED , highlighted a small number of areas where minor modifications to the 
DELIVERABLE ’s systems will be needed to meet UK -threshold KURs.  Engagement with  SUPPLIER  
has allowed the development of the Capability Roadmap at Annex B.  Several additional areas of 
potential collaboration to delivering continued operational effectiveness for the UK PROGRAMME 
NAME  capability have been identified; thi s OBC seeks approval for an initial investment in the 
associated cooperative development programme as outlined at Sub -para 1e (4) above.  
  
5. Support & Infrastructure Long Leads.   The long -lead activities within this OBC are required 
in parallel with development of the support solution ahead of FBC submission to meet the 
Logistic Support Date in  xx DATE .  The scope of the long -lead activities are:  Training Needs 
Analysis and early training development; non -recurring expenditure for synthetic training 
devices and software lab development; and initial spares provision.    CUSTOMER 
ORGANISATION  will confirm the infrastructure requirements and location during DATE  to 
protect the DATE  Logistic Support Date.  
  
6. Dependencies.   Key programme dependencies include the following:   
a. LOCATION  Development Plan.   As part of the ORGANISATION  Transformation 
project, led by REDACTED , to provide the basing arrangements and infrastructure location.   
b.   Training Pipeline.  To achieve the target IOC there is a dependency on REDACTED  
to train STAFF  preceding the UK EDD.   
c.      REDACTED  Programme.   The UK    programme is benefitting significantly from 
the modifications that the   is funding under the REDACTED  upgrade programme, including 
REDACTED  improvements, currently forecast for full embodiment by Q4 DATE .11    
d. REDACTED  Sustainment Programme.   The PROGRAMME NAME  is dependent on 
the provision of REDACTED    .  
e. REDACTED  Programme.   There will be a dependency on the  REDACTED  
Programme to provide GFx.   
f. Training Programme.   PROGRAMME NAME  is reliant upon the programme to provide the 
infrastructure necessary to enable distributed training.  
 
 
ECONOMIC CASE  
  
7. Procurement Strategy.12  The justification for a single -source procurement and the VfM 
arguments have been endorsed by the IAC and Ministers in the SOC13 and remain valid.  
8. VfM.  Discussions with  SUPPLIER  have established that its proposal is a ‘Product Line 
solution and Priced to Win’, evolved from previous DELIVERABLE  sales.  In the absence of detailed 
 
 
 
   
 
  
 bottom -up costs, a VfM Strategy has been developed14 and reviewed by REDACTED , which sets out 
how costs are broken down and demonstrates VfM using comparator benchmarks and a top -down 
analysis of material and labour rates and sub -contractor elements that underpin  SUPPLIER ’s 
proposal.   
9. Price.   At unit -price level, Figure 1 (Annex E) illustrates the average price per DELIVERABLE  
(total acquisition cost) for each previous customer, adjusted to DATE  economic conditions,15 and that 
offered to the UK - this information is commercially sensitive.  Development activities are a significant 
factor in the higher -level of costs incurred for REDACTED , thereafter learning in modification labour 
hours, demonstration activities and other cost efficiencies have introduced further improvements in 
price.  An initial proposal was received from  SUPPLIER  at a price of XXXX .  After negotiations, the 
revised price is XXXX .  This will be challenged again once the VfM analysis has been completed.  
Single Source Contract Regulations (SSCR) will apply to the Prime Contract with SUPPLIER , 
resulting in a Qualifying Defence Contract (QDC).  SSCR -compliance in t he sub -contract tiers is 
addressed in the Commercial section at Para 20 below.  
10. Analysis.   More detailed analysis will be carried out between  xx DATE - xx DATE  to inform 
contract negotiations.  The analysis will be supported by:  
a. SUPPLIER .   SUPPLIER  has a representative embedded with OTHER SUPPLIER  in 
LOCTION .   SUPPLIER  shall provide a report based on the pricing information released by  
SUPPLIER , on the reasonableness of the pricing construct, including reference to any known 
comparators.  
  
b. Cost Assurance.   CAAS has provided support to price investigation, focussing on UK 
comparator information.    
  
11. Pricing Breakdown.   The largest acquisition cost sits with OTHER SUPPLIER , for which the 
Company has shared details to Work Breakdown Structure Level -3, divided into Labour and 
Materials costs.  
  
12. ANOTHER SUPPLIER .  The prime contract with SUPPLIER  is expected to be in CURRENCY  
and procurement of items/services from the COUNTRY  are to be costed and paid in CURRENCY  to 
avoid negotiation of exchange rates where possible.  
  
13. Open Architecture Principles.   The solution is a mature, fielded product and was not 
designed against recognized open -system architecture principles; this is an area of standardization 
that is still being developed by both the COUNTRY  and the UK.16  However, assurances have been 
provided against the primary concerns, namely ease of future upgrade and exploitation of data 
generated by the system.  The  software architecture is both modular and layered, allowing upgrades 
to individual elements to be d eveloped independently prior to being tested at the system level.  
Furthermore, it uses interfaces that are clearly defined through a set of Interface Control Documents 
(ICDs) that previously have been used to integrate customer -defined requirements into t he system.   
Future spiral -development, done in cooperation with the REDACTED  on an arrangement, will be 
delivered in accordance with Open Architecture Principles to the greatest extent possible.   
FINANCIAL CASE  
14. Cost Model.   A cost model17 has been generated to support the ABL and the estimated 
wholelife cost.  It is predominantly based upon the  SUPPLIER  Firm Price and  SUPPLIER  
ROM costs for future support based on learned experience for the support model, with 
extensive support from  SUPPLIER  Defence COUNTRY for estimating purposes.  A CAAS 
 
 
 
 
    
 
  Approvals Team Report has been submitted to the IAC in parallel with this OBC. The report 
states that it is the CAT opinion that this OBC is fit for approval, provided the planned activities 
are conducted successfully, and reported at appropriate milestone s via IN(s) to the Approving 
Authority.  
  
15. Affordability .   The purchase of DELIVERABLE S including ORGANISATION  and infrastructure 
costing is £ XXXX  over the ABC  DATE  period (FY DATE  to FYDATE ). Utilising PROGRAMME 
NAME  ABC allocated funding of £ XXXX , plus a further £ XXXX  PROGRAMME NAME funding 
held centrally by CUSTOMER , leaves a residual pressure of £ x.  CUSTOMER  have undertaken 
programming action to mitigate this pressure including the following:  
  
a. £XXXX  - Action taken under FCR XX to reduce  DELIVERABLE S.  
  
b. £XXXX  - Implement further reduction of DELIVERABLE S by xx xx  DATE .  
  
c. £XXXX  - Bring forward OSD to FY DATES , 9 months prior to target IOC.9  
  
d. £XXXX  - Budget settlement bring forward measure to accelerate expenditure of 
DELIVERABLE  and secure SUPPLIER  Commercial DELIVERABLE  production slots.   
  
16. The application of these measures leaves the programme affordable in volume terms over the 
ABC DATE  period; however, there is a profiling issue, with a pressure of c. £ XXXX  in each of 
the first four years, offset by headroom in the later years.  Further work is underway to reduce 
this by exploring sales opportunities, including spares.  Annex E contains a summary of the 
financial position with programming action .  
  
17. FOREX Risk.   All costs included as part of this approval have been calculated based on the 
latest ( xx ) DDATE E FEM.18  The FOREX variation between this and the CPA rates is £ XXXX  
and is included in the ABL.19 In accordance with JSP xxx, a separate provision of £ XXXX  for 
foreign exchange risk, based on the latest DE FEM, between 70% and 50% confidence levels, 
has been calculated and is excluded from the ABL.  A separate approval provision for this 
additional risk has been requested as part of this OBC.  
18. VAT.  VAT advice has been sought from the NAME OF DEPARTMENT  Taxation Team20 and 
applied within the cost model at the relevant rates.  The REDACTED  will be a Qualifying 
DELIVERABLE  for VAT purposes, and therefore all procurement costs will be zero -rated.  VAT 
will apply to the infrastructure build and elements of the Support Segment . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
COMMERCIAL CASE  
  
 
 
 
   
 
  
 19. Commercial Strategy.   A Commercial Strategy21 has been developed and reviewed by ROLE  
as part of ongoing scrutiny engagement prior to OBC submission.  Key elements are 
summarized below.   
20. Contracting Model.   The main requirement will be fulfilled by placing a QDC with SUPPLIER .   
 SUPPLIER  will sub -contract the remaining acquisition elements through SUPPLIER , which will 
be the Coordinating Design Organization using its experience of fulfilling this role for other    
operators.  SUPPLIER  will sub -contract substantial elements to SUPPLIER , OTHER 
SUPPLIER  for the REDACTED , and REDACTED  for DELIVERABLE  conversion work.  A 
similar Contracting Model in which SUPPLIER  replaces SUPPLIER  as the Prime was 
discounted as it offered no material benefits in either programme execution or VfM compa red to 
the preferred model.  Plus, application of SSCR to a prime SUPPLIER  contract would be more 
challenging due to SUPPLIER ’s inexperience of the Regulations. SUPPLIER ’s experience of 
MOD business, working with SSCR and role as a MOD  SUPPLIER  interface means it is 
considered best placed to be the Prime Contractor.  
21.  SUPPLIER / SUPPLIER  Contractual Framework.    SUPPLIER  has a contractual framework in 
place with OTHER SUPPLIER  that pre -dates the Defence Reform Act 2014, which means any 
work placed between those parties and any sub -contracts placed by  SUPPLIER  are not subject 
to the SSCR and therefore will not become QSC.  Central Legal Services (CLS) has provided 
advice in support of this position.22  
22. Contracting Timeline.  To secure long -lead items and maximize in -year accrual opportunities, 
NAME OF DEPARTMENT  will seek contract agreement on price and terms for the 
DELIVERABLE S acquisition, plus long -lead items for support and infrastructure by xx DATE .  
23. Terms and Conditions (T&Cs).   T&Cs are being developed and negotiated.  ROLE  will 
complete a due -diligence exercise on T&Cs prior to contract offer.  
24. Pricing.   A Firm Price will be negotiated for both the Product Line solution, and separately for 
UK modifications.  Pricing for lower -value work packages (c£ x) such as Training Needs 
Analysis, and infrastructure design will be based on Ascertained Costs.  
25. Profit Rate.   The Profit Rate will be calculated using the 6 -step process applicable under the 
SSCR.  Incentivization might be applied up to X% of cost to improve schedule, subject to 
appropriate risk transfer being agreed by SUPPLIER .  SUPPLIER  has confirmed that Profit will 
only be charged on Cost Once for all SUPPLIER  elements of the price in line with SSCR.  
26. Legal Advice.  CLS has been engaged throughout the Concept Phase and has provided 
advice to support application of Article 346(1)(b), exempting the procurement from the Defence 
& Security Public Contracts Regulations.  It has also, under legal privilege, provided advice  
assessing the risk of a successful challenge to the MOD’s decision to pursue single -source 
procurement with SUPPLIER .  
MANAGEMENT CASE  
  
27. Through -Life Management (TLM).  The programme is governed by the tri -annual, cross -DLoD  
Programme Working Group and 1* Programme Board ch aired by the SRO.  The Programme  
Mandate details the required programme outcomes and the Programme Definition Document  
(PDD) expands on the outcomes, delivery approach and management strategies. The PROGRAMME 
NAME NAME OF DEPARTMENT  Project Management Plan (PMP) documents the plan, means, 
methods and controls and will be maintained in accordance with NAME OF DEPARTMENT  Policy.  
The contract with SUPPLIER  will include an obligation for Earned Value Management reporting and 
 
 
    
 
  performance governance arrangements, mirroring those implemented successfully on the 
PREVIOUS  programme.   
28. Schedule.  A high -level programme milestone plan is at Annex C with further detail to be 
presented as part of the FBC.  The target IOC of DATE  has been built on cross -DLoD 
deterministic plans; a full schedule risk analysis is subject to securing the DELIVERABLE , 
maturing the tailoring aspects, test programme and Initial Support Solution arrangements prior 
to Contract Award by xx DATE .  An IN will be issued at this point to update the IAC on the 50% 
confidence IOC plans.  A resourced schedule23 at Annex F details the activities leading to the 
FBC and which will be managed through the NAME OF DEPARTMENT  baseline control 
process.  An Initial Baseline Review will be conducted upon approval of this OBC.  
29. Assurance & Approvals.   An Integrated Assurance & Approvals Plan (IAAP)24 has been 
produced and will be managed in accordance with HM Treasury Major Projects Guidance.  
30. Benefits Strategy.   The PROGRAMME NAME follows the overarching Benefits Management 
principles defined in the  ORGANISATION  Benefits Management Strategy.  A Benefits 
Realisation Plan has been developed and the realization measures will be matured ahead of 
the FBC.  
31. Risk.  The highest programme risks are summarized at Annex D, with the risks held in the 
Programme Level and NAME OF DEPARTMENT  ARM risk register.  The risks and 
uncertainties have been incorporated into the cost model and management reserve.  The top 3 
risks are:    
a. Risk 1:   Transition from existing CAPABILITY  to new capability.   
b. Risk 2:   Delay in decision making resulting in a loss of pre -delivery DELIVERABLE  
and/or  SUPPLIER  Product Line manufacturing slots.   
c. Risk 3:  Insufficient SQEP (Suitably Qualified & Experienced People) across key DLoDs 
to both mature the FBC and to meet programme timeline.   
CROSS DLoD  
  
32. Key points from DLoD strategies are summarized in Annex G with further information being 
found in the individual DLoD strategies referenced in Annex G.  DLoD risks are included within 
the risk register, with the highest detailed at Annex D.    
UK WORK CONTENT   
33.  SUPPLIER  has confirmed its plans for final assembly of the DELIVERABLE  to be undertaken 
at  LOCATION  for around X manhours of work per DELIVERABLE  realizing around X direct 
jobs.  Furthermore,  SUPPLIER  has confirmed its intent to use the same facility to meet any 
future sales opportunities for other customers.25  The NAME OF DEPARTMENT  DT is 
negotiating with SUPPLIER  on Commercial Exploitation Agreements applicable to UK elements 
and start -up costs for the production line.  Through -life support and training will be undertaken 
within the UK with an estimated X% of the value of the through -life support directly leading to 
UK jobs.  In total, it is anticipated that over a third of the project value will lead directly to UK 
jobs.  MOD is continuing discussions with SUPPLIER  to explore wider UK Prosperity 
opportunities under the auspices of the HMG/  SUPPLIER  Proprie ty Agreement; an overview of 
potential direct UK industrial opportunities is at Annex H.  
  
PRESENTATION & HANDLING  
 
 
 
   
 
  
   
34. The potential procurement of DELIVERABLE  and in particular the single -source approach with 
SUPPLIER  has attracted significant Parliamentary and media interest.  It is expected that this 
level of interest will continue during the approvals process and up to contract award.  Current 
Lines to Take (LTT) remain extant and are regularly reviewed.  Close work ing with Directorate 
of Defence Communications (DDC), NAME OF DEPARTMENT  Corporate Communications and 
NAME OF DEPARTMENT  Policy Secretariat teams will be mai ntained and revised LTT will be 
produced by a dedicated comms team.

      Prob  T  C  P  
1  Cause:  
There is a risk that REDACTED if REDACTED  is not properly managed.  
Event:  
Transition from existing CAPABILITY  to new capability.    
Impact:  
The risk will delay the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) or lead to a capability gap.  
  1. REDACTED .   
2. Transition WG has been established.   
3. Transition plan to be developed between 
OBC and FBC.   High  Med  Med  
2  Cause:  
Delay in decision making may result in loss of manufacturing slots with SUPPLIER .   
Event:  
There are a finite number of available production slots as  SUPPLIER  transitions to DELIVERABLE 
production. SUPPLIER  will be seeking customers for these slots. If there is a delay in any decision 
and these slots are sold to other customers, this could impact the Programme's ability to proceed.   
Impact:   
REDACTED  may be unavailable or only available at an inflated price, adding cost or delay to the  
Programme.  The programme may seek alternative second -hand DELIVERABLE  but there is no 
guarantee that there will be suitable DELIVERABLE  at low hours and of a common configuration.    1. Secure 2 x undelivered DELIVERABLE  
DELIVERABLE  to accelerate the programme timeline.   
2. Early commitment to secure th e 
DELIVERABLE .   
3. Engagement with  SUPPLIER  at Senior level 
to secure the DELIVERABLE , price and timeline.  
  Med  Med  -  
3  Cause:  
There are risks that the programme has neither sufficient SQEP, nor resources, to assess 
programme requirements moving forward, and deliver the Programme's outcomes when required. 
[This risk is an amalgam of Infra, Info, Logistics and Equipment DLoD top le vel resource risks].  
Event:  
Insufficient Suitably Qualified and Experienced Personnel and resourcing level to carry out 
Assessment Phase requirements and delivery activities for DLoD lead delivery agencies to meet 
Programme timeline.    
Impact:  
This could delay the delivery of the programme, as requirements will first need to be assessed 
before delivery phase can progress. Similarly, if requirements are not correctly identified, this will 
impact performance.  This could also delay the overall man agement of the programme, leading to 
risks and issues not being identified in sufficient time to be mitigated without delay to IOC.  1. Appoint a Lead Delivery Organisation 
manager, and an ICT Requirements Engineer to work 
with NAME OF DEPARTMENT  to develop ICT 
requirements.    
2. Appoint and resource a lead delivery 
organisation for the infrastructure solution.   
3. To supplement NAME OF DEPARTMENT  
DT recruitment, funding is being sought for additional 
Engineering, Integrated Logistics and Project delivery 
resource from the NAME OF DEPARTMENT  Delivery 
partners .   Med  Low  Med      
  
  
 
  
 4  Cause:  
There is a risk that to meet all UK specific requirements unforeseen significant modifications are 
required to the SUPPLIER  Product Line that cannot be delivered in time for IOC .  
Event:   
UK specific requirements exceed the current proposed time and cost basis of estimate baseline 
configuration; detailed design work is still to be done.  1. Establish UK specific capability 
requirements early and analyse against Product Line 
baseline, using established requirements (e.g.  ) as 
baseline wherever possible.  
2. Developed Capability Roadmap and map 
against the Product Line.  
3. UK minor modifications to the Product Line

DLoD Strategies Summary  
  
1. Training.  A through -life training solution is assessed as deliverable and the UK 
training solution will draw on the experience and  SUPPLIER -delivered training system 
in place for the  
    A.  Prior to IOC, the intent is to utilise training provided through the  ; over time a UK -led 
and LOCATION -based solution will be developed that will utilise a blended Service  
provisioned and contractor solution.  This will be prioritised and resourced to provide an 
optimum live/synthetic training balance using the phased approach detailed within the 
PROGRAMME NAME Training Strategy26.  
2. Equipment.  
 
   
 a. Certification and Safety.   Early engagement with  SUPPLIER  with support 
from the NAME OF DEPARTMENT    Team has enabled the collaborative development 
of an initial   Strategy that outlines the intended approach to the management 
throughout the Service life of the platform.  The Strategy includes a summary of how 
the Type   Authority intends to achieve Military Type Certification as well as the 
intended approach to demonstrating compliance with the Design Safety Target .  It has 
been reviewed at desk level by ( ACCREDITOR ) and has been approved by 
REDACTED .  A separate Certification Strategy will be developed during XX DATE  and 
submitted to the  ACCREDITOR  to formally initiate the certification process.   
b. Acceptance Strategy.  An initial Integrated Test and Evaluation Plan (ITEAP) 
has been developed which sets out a strategy for how it will be introduced into service.  
This Plan will be refined as the strategy for introducing the UK -specific modifications 
into the ‘Product Line’ is refined prior to contract award, and further developed prior to 
FBC submission.  The procurement of a pred ominantly ‘off -the-shelf’ platform means 
that the majority of traditional design test and evaluation has already been comple ted 
and post -modification Design Organisation -led activity on the first UK DELIVERABLE  
is likely to be minimal.  However, there will be opportunities for the  ORGANISATION  
Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) community to cooperate in this activity, and 
opportunities to benefit from T&E and operational experience will also need to be 
exploited to minimise the period between EDD and IOC.  
c. Technology Management.   The following sub -paragraphs outline the four -
step process that the UK intends to take with regard to the development of the 
capability:  
(1) ‘Product Line’ (PL) Capability.   The capability as initially offered to the UK 
consists predominantly mature and fielded technology taken from a combination 
of the commercial PREVIOUS  programme and previous deliveries to 
COUNTRIES.   These will be complemented by several updates that are being 
developed as part of the ongoing programme, the design of the final release of 
which is expected to be frozen in Q1 DATE . Additional activity will be required to 
ensure that the UK configuration is aligned with the lat est commercial baseline 
configuration (i.e. to address in -line obsolescence and production changes), but 
this is expected to be low risk and will commence immediately after contract 
award.  
(2) Capability Tailoring.   When assessed against the KURs, the Product Line 
version had a number of minor shortfalls, and SUPPLIER  have agreed to 
develop a small number of modifications to introduce additional capabilities to 
mitigate the gaps. These relate to high maturity technologies already fielded on 
other military platforms with the immaturity of integration forming much of the  
associated technical risk; this will be mitigated by parallel development of these 
capabilities alongside Product Line configuration alignment.  
(3) Capability Studies.   In addition to the list of modifications that have been 
agreed as being necessary to tailor the Product Line capability to meet UK 
requirements, a small number of additional studies will be conducted ahead of 
FBC.  These are not expected to be fielded as  part of the UK configuration at 
FOC; however, if these studies highlight an opportunity which is containable 
within delivery cost and/or time bounds then these will be highlighted to the SRO 
and considered as part of the FBC approval. T he value of such studies will be 
reviewed as they progress with a view to ceasing their progress early if their 
progress becomes incoherent.     
 (4) UK Collaborative Development.   With regard to the need to ensure that the 
UK capability remains relevant out to the envisaged OSD, this business case 
seeks approval to participate in the collaborative development of a number of 
concepts for REDACTED,  communications, and survivability.  This activity will 
run in parallel to the main procurement programme under a collaborative project 
arrangement with the NAME OF COUNTRY and NAME OF COUNTRY  and may 
inform a future decision to pursue an upgrade project.  Follo w-on stages for 
further development, embodiment and costing will be subject to separate 
approvals.  
d. Comparison with PREVIOUS PROGRAMME .  UK is expected to be very 
similar to the DELIVERABLE  at the post -Phase 5A configuration.  In addition to a 
number of component -level changes related to obsolescence that will not impact 
on the overall platform performance, the platforms will have the following key 
capability differences:  
         REDACTED  
3. Personnel.   
a.   CUSTOMER ORGANISATION  Personnel.   The PROGRAMME NAME  
Personnel Strategy states REDACTED.  The Workforce Strategy will inform the 
deliverability of the Personnel DLoD against the KURs and Key Capability 
Requirements (KCR) in order to achieve programme milestones. Prior to FBC, 
Manpower Requirements staff will engage with PROGRAMME NAME ,  
ORGANISATION  FHQ and all cross -DLoD parties to review platform workforce 
requirements.  Extant workforce liability will be used to provision the workforce 
requirements for PROGRAMME NAME .  
b. NAME OF DEPARTMENT  Personnel.   The existing PROGRAMME NAME 
team will need to increase in size rapidly as detailed in the Staff Resource Plan at 
Annex E.  A resource -based schedule has been developed to define the time -based 
requirements for different functional skills and this will be used to articulate the 
demand  signal to NAME OF DEPARTMENT  Functional Managers.  In the short term, it 
is anticipated that this demand will be met by procuring additional resource from the 
NAME OF DEPARTMENT Engineering Delive ry Partner and Project Delivery Partner 
(PDP).  
4. Information.   The Information DLoD owner is responsible for assurance that DLoD 
deliverers’ outputs for the programme meet time and quality requirements, and that 
reporting is complete and accurate.  As described in the PROGRAMME NAME 
Information Strategy, they will provide a level of assurance to the SRO that the 
information aspects of the capability are fit for purpose. The Programme intends to 
assign NAME OF DEPARTMENT  as the Lead Delivery Agent for delivery of ICT 
Equipment and Services.  NAME OF DEPART MENT will be given the means, and 
financial resources, to direct ORGANISATION  to enable fulfilment of Equipment and 
Support related Information requirements, via an assigned ORGANISATION  Lead 
Delivery Organisation (LDO) Manager and commodity equipment teams, as required.  
The ORGANISATION LDO Manager will be Lead Delivery Agent for wider Information 
requirements (e.g. IT for the Main Operating Base) working with the Information 
Requirement Manager and  CUSTOMER ORGANISATION  as necessary.  
5. Doctrine .  The PROGRAMME NAME CONEMP provides the context and detail for the 
employment of the following capabilities : REDACTED.  The CONEMP has been 
produced as the inaugural element of the Concept Phase of PROGRAMME NAME .  It 
will be reviewed by programme stakeholders ahead of FBC and in response to the 
proposed solution and the capabilities that brings.  Future reviews will be initiated by   
 the SRO, and led by the Doctrine and Concepts DLoD lead, on behalf of the Lead 
User.  
6. Organisation .  For the purpose of the PROGRAMME NAME Organisation Strategy, it 
is assumed that DELIVERABLE  will fit into the current organisational structure at 
LOCATION .  In summary, this consists REDACTED .  The  ORGANISATION  
Operational Conversion Unit (OCU) will provide the training for UK STAFF to fulfil 
training requirements against a minimal manpower volume.  Tasking will be conducted 
under existing  arrangements.   
7. Infrastructure . Infrastructure work is at an early stage with user requirements, 
delivery approach, and risk analysis still being developed.  Early PROGRAMME NAME 
Infrastructure Strategy planning assumptions against the ABC DATE  option for upgrading  D 
considered the refurbishment of the existing infrastructure at LOCATION .  However, an 
alternative option to build a new strategic facility is now also being assessed, drawing on the 
experience of a similar project at LOCATION .  UK will be introduced at a time of significant 
capability change at LOCATION .  Whilst this complexity has the potential to introduce 
programme risk, this is being mitigated through the establishment of a Development Plan as 
part of the  ORGANISATION  Transformation project, led by REDACTED .  The 
PROGRAMME NAME Infra DLoD will work closely with the team to  ensure coherence, 
efficiency and value for money.  
 
a. LOCATION  remaining as the REDACTED  has been a major planning 
assumption since inception of the Capability Sustainment Programme.  
(1) Synergies with the wider ORGANISATION  and Intelligence communities.  
The proximity to ORGANISATION  and Intelligence community’s colocation 
with other ORGANISATION  assets allows a cross fertilisation of experience 
and sharing of specialist  ORGANISATION  resource.  
(2) Operating range and ability to reach common operating areas.  LOCATION 
is ideally located to allow REDACTED.   
(3) Retention of Service and Civilian personnel.  There is an established core 
of PROGRAMME NAME SQEP at LOCATION .    
b. An infrastructure Delivery Agent has yet to be appointed; the most appropriate 
Delivery Agent will be selected once key decision points are reached in the 
infrastructure planning.  This may be the NAME OF DEPARTMENT 1 , another 
government department, or the infrastructure may be delivered through the prime 
contractor  SUPPLIER .  This decision will be reached on the basis of the best VfM 
alongside an acceptable level of programmatic risk.  A NTE approval for the whole 
build is being requested in this OBC to e nsure planning and construction can continue 
at pace and reduce the risk of facilities not being available at In Service Date (ISD).  
The FBC will confirm infrastructure decisions and associated costs.  
  
8.  Logistics .  In accordance with the PROGRAMME NAME Logistics Strategy, the 
Logs DLoD plans to deliver an assured, sustainable, support solution that will be fit for 
purpose to meet the demands of PROGRAMME NAME , through NAME OF DEPARTMENT  
delivery of contracted Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) aligning to, and achieving 
coherence with, the delivery of required GFX. PROGRAMME NAME  and the Logs DLoD will 
engage with the NAME OF DEPARTMENT  and CUSTOMER Delivery teams to identify 
synergies in logistics sup port.   
 a.  Support Strategy.  The intention for the UK is to develop an output -based 
service linking the industry support solution to the delivery of operational outputs.  The 
initial support Logistic Support Date is assumed to be X months prior to the DATE  In-
Service Date, with Forward support based at LOCATION , and industry Depth 
maintenance offbase.   The construct for Forward is assumed to be CUSTOMER -led, 
supported by industry.  During the initial support period UK operating and support 
information will be gathered to enable the support service or elements within it to be 
competed during the follow -on future support phase after circa X years when effective 
and VfM to do so.  
(1)  The support strategy outlined above will be matured ahead of FBC 
and will build upon the DATE RfP response from SUPPLIER .  The SUPPLIER  
UK support proposal is based around the extant SUPPLIER  support solution and 
costings for DELIVERABLE  and its X years of operating experience and costs.  
During DATE  SUPPLIER  Defence UK and the Delivery Team have developed 
joint support opportunities to enhance the support solution and significantly 
reduce the proposed support costs.  These opportunities will be mature d during 
the Assessment Phase and embedded in the initial support contract.  
Consequently, the proposed UK support solution has a solid  foundation upon 
which to build and apply lessons learned.  
(2)  Ahead of FBC, opportunities to co -operate with COUNTRY  will be 
explored, especially for the Support Segment for the synthetic training devices, 
and system software support.  In addition, the intent is also to exploit the wide 
commercial support base available for the large DELIVERABLE  fleet, as well us 
synergies with the MOD’s ( DELIVERABLE  based) support solution.
