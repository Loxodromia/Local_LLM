Introduction

During multiple construction activities it is required to
have operatives working close to the roof edge. Roof
edge protection is therefore required.

On previous projects it has been necessary to move or
otherwise alter the roof edge protection during the
works. This increases the risk and introduces further
opportunities for accidents to occur.

It is therefore considered that the roof edge protection
elements and planning should be reviewed to ensure
that any potential issues are identified and that the
best strategy is taken forward.

Brief

Minimise necessary alterations to the roof edge protection systems to significantly reduce the
inherent risk of working at height.

Main priorities:

* Minimise operatives exposure to unprotected roof
edges.

¢ Eliminate or reduce number of required changes to
the roof edge protection.

* Increase safety with roof working

Other issues considered:

* Integration of permanent edge protection
* Construction sequencing

* Cost

¢ Flexibility

* Local upstand and handrail issue at external stairwell access
location.

* Sequencing greatly improved due to upstand detail.

Past Experience Summary

* The use of upstands allows more works to be
undertaken without moving the initial edge
protection

* Make sure upstand large enough to fit a
handrail baseplate

* LLC should discuss with concrete frame
contractor where the temporary handrail is
installed

* Planning in advance can reduce the edge
protection iterations required.

* It is possible to use the permanent edge
protection as temporary edge protection

* Different system required for steel frame
elements
