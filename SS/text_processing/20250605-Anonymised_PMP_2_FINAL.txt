INTRODUCTION

1. Purpose of the Project Management Plan

1.1. This project management plan (PMP) describes the project definition,
management structure and methodology for the PROGRAMME NAME
acquisition project. It is prepared by the project manager (PM), in
collaboration with the delivery team (DT), and approved by the person to
whom the PM is accountable for project delivery.

1.2. |t seeks to ensure that consistency, adequate communication, co-ordination
and controls are in place. It enables all parties involved in the project to know
how their contribution fits into the overall plan.

1.3. Revision 6 of the plan describes the management of all project elements up
until the In-Service phase but will evolve through the project lifecycle. The
current phase (Manufacture) includes:

1.3.1. Acquisition of three (3) PROGRAMME NAME DELIVERABLE, to meet
the (Capability Description) capability. This is part of the scope.

1.3.2. Further acquisition of the (Objective) scope (UK modifications of the
DELIVERABLE and incorporation of (Capability) into the
DELIVERABLE).

1.3.3. Acquisition of the DELIVERABLE, also in support of the platform
(namely Training and Support elements).

1.3.4. Delivery of Infrastructure to support the platform at its LOCATION,
DEPARTMENT NAME LOCATION.

1.4. The PMP is a working document, maintained under configuration control by
the Delivery Team (DT) and only approved versions should be used. It will be
reviewed and revised as appropriate by the Project Management Team.

3.1 Overview

3.1.1. REDACTED

3.1.2 The Outline Business Case (OBC) approved the acquisition of
DELIVERABLE under a single-source, direct commercial sale from
COMPANY with an OSD no earlier than DATE. The OBC provided an
Approved Budgetary Level (ABL) totaling £ XXXX M. Due to financial
challenges within the MOD, the Integrated Review (IR) directed a
reduction in scope from SOME to LESS DELIVERABLES, alongside
an earlier decision to move the DELIVERABLE to DEPARTMENT
NAME LOCATION. The Full Business Case (FBC) will request an
updated Approved Budgetary Level (ABL) for the acquisition of

DELIVERABLE, request approval for a Sustainment contract

alongside OTHER PROGRAMME DELIVERABLE at DEPARTMENT

NAME LOCATION and request approval for major programme

milestones.

3.2DEPARTMENT NAME 1 Role

3.2.1 The DEPARTMENT NAME 1 role in the programme is to manage the
MOD Equipment DLOD for all phases of the CADMID cycle, prior to
equipment being introduced into service; time, cost and performance
approvals will be received. In addition, DEPARTMENT NAME 1 will
provide certain programme support services including maintenance of
the through life pan-DLOD cost model. DEPARTMENT NAME 1 will act
as the point of contact for all associated commercial activity and will
manage delivery against the Main Acquisition Contract for
DELIVERABLE.

3.2.2. DEPARTMENT NAME 1 will lead delivery on aspects of the Logistics
DLOD in order to ensure that the platform can be sustained at home
and when deployed, the detail of which will be defined through the
development and agreement of an SoR for the sustainment contract;
the Logistics Support Date (LSD) will be the milestone by which time
this support is in place. DEPARTMENT NAME 1 will ensure that
service support contracts are in place prior to delivery of the equipment
to the Customer dependent upon the programme securing timely
approvals for sustainment in coordination with DEPARTMENT NAME
1.

3.2.3. In accordance with direction received post the SofS directed review
and DATE Integrated Review, DEPARTMENT NAME 1 are to act as
the Lead Delivery Agent to oversee delivery of PROGRAMME NAME
infrastructure at DEPARTMENT NAME LOCATION in accordance with
the schedules and budgetary allocations as agreed between
DEPARTMENT NAME 1 and TLB. The Infrastructure DLOD is owned
by TLB and DEPARTMENT NAME 1 are not responsible for the
management of DLOD activity, but for managing contracted
deliverables, in the capacity as Lead Delivery Agent.

3.2.4 DEPARTMENT NAME 1 will act as the Lead Delivery Agent for those
aspects of the Information DLOD delivered by Defence Digital (DD),
however they will not be responsible for management of the
Information DLOD.

4. Requirements
4.1Key User Requirements

4.1.1. The User Requirements Document (URD) is the mechanism by which
the SRO translates the capability required to meet the UK’s Defence
objectives into clearly defined requirements. It is a dynamic document
which has been developed primarily during the Concept Phase, from
the identification of a capability need up to Initial Gate approval. It will
then be maintained through the life of the system to reflect changing
user needs. REDACTED. At the time of issue, the following Single
Statement of User Need was agreed:

User Requirement Statement:

“The User requires a REDACTED DELIVERABLE capability to provide
REDACTED”

4.1.2 The Key User Requirements (KURs), endorsed by the Joint
Requirements Oversight Committee (JROC), are laid out in Table 3:

Id Key User Requirement
1.1 The User requires a capability that REDACTED.

1.2 The User requires a capability that can REDACTED.

1.5 The User requires a capability that is REDACTED.
2.1 The User requires a capability to REDACTED.

2.4 The User requires a capability that can incorporate Capability
enhancements and undertake new or additional roles.

3.1 The User requires a capability to REDACTED.

3.5 The User requires a capability that REDACTED in LOCATIONS.

41 The User requires a capability that can direct or support all TLB
roles within the LOCATION.

Table 3: Key User Requirements.

4.1.3. The Concept of Employment (CONEMP) provides a baseline from
which the User and subsequent System Requirement Documents
(URD and SRD) can consider different or novel solutions to providing
the (CAPABILITY), whilst allowing the development of current solutions
through technical insertion. This document has been developed by the
Requirements Manager.

4.1.4 The System Requirements Document (SRD) is the structured and live
definition of the optimal system requirements (including constraints},
bounding contracting and verification activities. Whilst an SRD was
drafted for the PROGRAMME and used as a comparison document to
assess the configuration of the ‘product line’ REDACTED that
DELIVERY AGENT initially offered to the UK, it was not finalised and
was not updated following this assessment. Instead, a Product
Specification Document (PSD) was produced and included as a
Schedule within the acquisition contract as the document that defines
the specification of the contracted product. Segment, System and
Subsystem specifications that sit beneath the PSD are managed by
DELIVERY AGENT and have been provided to the MOD on request.

5.1.1 The Project is an Investment Category ‘A’ Project, as defined by Joint
Service Publication (JSP) x. All new Cat A and B programmes are
required to present a Strategic Outline Case (SOC) to the Approving
Authority (AA). Programmes that have already undertaken a SOC will
be expected to follow the process through Outline Business Case
{OBC) to Full Business Case (FBC) where necessary utilising Review
Notes (RN) or Information Notes (IN) to engage the AA.

5.1.2 Project performance will be monitored throughout to ensure that KURs
are being satisfied and evidence is being gathered to support
acceptance of the programme capabilities into Service, in accordance
with COMPLIANCE Monitoring and Control Strategy.

5.1.3. The PROGRAMME NAME employs various methods of delivery,

5.4Constraints

5.4.1. The Programme will operate and deliver within the following
constraints:

5.4.1.1 Changes to the Project funding levels or profiles outside the
delegated authority can only be made with the agreement of the
SRO.

5.4.1.2 The onus rests with TLB to review the options for how financial
efficiencies or under-spends might be reinvested to deliver early or
additional capability or reallocated across the TLB Portfolio.

5.4.1.3. Legal statutory compliance (including commercial).
5.4.1.4 Regulatory compliances: TLB Related Agencies).
5.4.1.5 Interoperability with allies.

6 Deliverables and Acceptance Criteria

6.1 Project deliverables.

6.1.1 Project Deliverables are agreed as part of the Programme Command
Acquisition and Support Plan (CASP)'. This document is the primary
means to govern the ENABLING ORGANISATION/Customer
relationship; it records the scope of DEPARTMENT NAME 1 outputs
within the programme, and it defines measures of output performance.
The CASP includes the following delivery work areas:

6.1.1.1. TLB Mission Segment. The MISSION SEGMENT comprises
the TLB RELATED DELIVERABLE -— based on the DELIVERABLE,
and the Mission Systems incorporated into the TLB System. The
current requirement includes the procurement of DELIVERABLES.

6.1.1.2 UK Modifications. Six specific modifications are included
which are designed to align the platform with current UK
requirements, as follows:

6.1.1.2.1, REDACTED via a REDACTED capability, integrated into the
mission system.

6.1.1.2.2 REDACTED capability integrated into the mission system.
6.1.1.2.3 Software changes that incorporate the LATEST
TECHNOLOGY

6.1.1.2.4 COMMUNICATION CAPABILITIES
6.1.1.2.5 CAPABILITIES, integrated into the mission system.
6.1.1.2.6 SAFETY DELIVERABLE

6.1.1.3. DEPENDENCY The DEPENDENCY consists of Training
Devices, Mission Support elements (e.g., a mission planning
facility) and the REDACTED Support Facility. Details on these
outputs can be found in the PROGRAMME Engineering
Management Plan (EMP).

6.1.1.4 — Infrastructure. Technical infrastructure at DEPARTMENT
NAME LOCATION that allows PROGRAMME to operate alongside
OTHER PROGRAMME.

6.1.1.5 Sustainment. Sustainment will be defined in the Final Business
Case (FBC) and subject to its own Service Delivery Plan (SDP).

6.2 Acceptance Strategy.

6.2.1 An Integrated Test & Evaluation Acceptance Strategy (ITEA) has been
developed for the Programme. This recognises that the UK
DELIVERABLE has been procured as a predominantly off-the-shelf
capability and many of the system requirements are envisaged to have
been previously verified for other programmes, supplier led Testing and
Evaluation (T&E) effort pre-delivery will therefore focus on the
integration of configuration changes and regression test of inherent
capabilities. A period of follow-on T&E will be required after delivery to
refine the performance of the DELIVERABLES CAPABILITY, develop
operational procedures and gather evidence for satisfaction of
capability requirements. This is expected to include a period where
each DELIVEABLE will be deployed to the LOCATION.

Project Exclusions

7.1 The following activities are excluded from DEPARTMENT NAME 1 project
scope:

7.1.1. Programme management activities including programme support
office duties and coordination of other DLODs, unless specifically
identified deliverables.

7.1.2 User requirements management, including the URD.

7.1.3 Capability Planning and Joint Requirements Oversight Committee
(JROC) briefing.

7.1.4. PROGRAMME Through Life Management Plan (TLMP).
7.1.6 Benefits Management.

7.1.6 TLBMDAL Management.

8 Assumptions and Dependencies
8.1 The delivery of the Programme is framed by the strategic assumptions listed
in Table 8, if they do not materialise the viability of the initiative may be in
jeopardy or have significant delivery, performance cost and schedule
implications.
ID | Key Assumption and Reason Held by Expiry
Date
1 Title: Out-of-Service Date (OSD) no earlier than DATE. SRO DATE
Reason: An OSD of at least DATE will align with key allies and the
REDACTED.
Impact if incorrect: A service life of c.X years is realistic and will provide
value-for-money (VfM). Failure to achieve this date will likely leave a gap in
capability.
2 | Title: Infrastructure requirements will be partially satisfied through synergies Dir DATE

with OTHER PROGRAMME.

Reason: To achieve VfM for Defence, new build infrastructure should be
minimised. Infrastructure savings through synergies with OTHER
PROGRAMME are required to meet the IR saving target.

Impact if incorrect: Increased cost to Defence.
3. | Title: The DELIVERABLE TRAINING MATERIAL will connect to the SYSTEM SRO DATE
NAME.
Reason: The connection to SYSTEM NAME will enable large-scale,
distributed collective trg across the UK and international partners.
Impact if incorrect: Failure to take advantage of the connection to SYSTEM
NAME will limit DELIVERABLE USERS trg to local made delivery only. As a
result, the quality and intensity of trg will be at risk.
Table 8: Key Assumptions.
8.2 Programme dependencies are captured within the Master Data and
Assumptions List (MDAL) and the CASP. TLB will store the Master versions of
the Programme MDAL on their SharePoint site and maintain configuration
control of the document with DLoDs remaining responsible for ensuring their
entries are updated. Programme assumptions are managed on SYSTEM.

PROJECT EXECUTION

9 Objectives

9.1 The Programme will contribute to the DEPARTMENT NAME’s Strategic
Objectives as follows:

Strategic Title Contribution
Objective

The PROGRAMME NAME DELIVERABLE will provide a
CAPABILITY, REDACTED. The PROGRAMME NAME
DELIVERABLE will be capable against current and future
threats, whilst complying with environmental and

4 REDACTED regulatory changes. It will deliver a capability that can
meet REDACTED. The complex modification activity
associated with DELIVERABLE will be completed in the
UK, REDACTED, promoting UK prosperity, and building
industrial resilience.

The PROGRAMME NAME DELIVERABLE capability will
continue to evolve to meet the threat into the future. The
DIGITAL solution with a significant growth path. The
DELIVERABLE will grow to continue to support the
operator, the Electronic Support Measures solution will be
REDACTED. The combination of these systems, including
a modern defensive aids suite and CAPABILTY, will
ensure the global reach and can operate effectively
against the future threat.

The UK PROGRAMME NAME is part of a group of nations
2 REDACTED. alongside OTHER. The nations have formally committed
to the following Joint Vision Statement:

REDACTED Our operational output will be enhanced
through mutual support, shared resources, and
commonality. Our capability enhancements will be
coordinated, tested, and shared to counter current and
future threats. The sustainment of our capability will
leverage the collective power of our nations, bringing
greater operational reliability through efficiencies of scale
and collaboration.”
10 Strategy
10.1 Project Strategy

10.1.1 The intent of the Programme is to recapitalise the PREVIOUS
DELIVERABLE with a DELIVERABLE. The PROGRAMME NAME will
provide a CAPABILITY that meets environmental and regulatory
changes and achieves REDACTED.

10.1.2 The capability will remain interoperable with allies, provide the UK's
contribution to the ALLIED Force, and remain capable against current
and future threats. The DEPARTMENT NAME is engaged on the
PROGRAMME NAME Capability with COUNTRIES. The nations will continue
to share their capability roadmaps, building on opportunities for
collaborative capability development, operation, and sustainment.

10.2 Procurement Strategy

10.2.1 The Investments Approval Committee (IAC) endorsed a single-source
procurement route for the DELIVERABLE. The acquisition will
comprise of DELIVERABLES.

10.2.2 The justification for single source for the DELIVERABLE Sustainment
solution is outlined in the Commercial and Procurement Strategy,
which was approved in DATE.

10.3 Commercial Strategy

10.3.1 The main acquisition of the TLB including the PROVIDER
DELIVERABLE, and all but one of the subsequent contract
amendments are Firm Priced. The UK specific modifications are priced
using a Target Cost Incentive Fee (TCIF) arrangement.

10.3.2 As this contract uses only firm and TCIF pricing, there is no impact
upon the contracted price from increases, using inflation as an
example. An inflation factor will have been included for transparency,
within the original PROVIDER proposal cost models to form the overall
price offers accepted by the Authority. Therefore, there is no
requirement for a Variation of Price clause within this contract.

10.3.3 The Statement of Requirement (SoR) for the contract is split into 7
different line items which are priced individually. The 7-line items cover
the following:

manage the acquisition of the AMS, MSS and REDACTED for the
PROGRAMME Programme. The PM Team liaise with other PM
stakeholders across the PROGRAMME Programme to track project
schedule and cost to ensure efficient delivery. Responsibilities include
the delivery of PROGRAMME Training Devices, delivery of the
acquisition contract and authority management of FMS cases.

11.3.2 The PM team are responsible for reporting project progress to the
Authority and to the Programme Management Team. The PM Team
manage and maintain Project Management artefacts, including the
Project History, Project Maturity Matrix and Project Management Plan.

11.4 Occupational Health, Safety and Environmental Management

11.4.1 The PROGRAMME Safety and Release to Service (RTS) Team is

responsible for managing and overseeing all safety, environmental,

RTS, Configuration Management and Quality Assurance activities in

support of the PROGRAMME NAME platform. They will lead development
and implementation of strategies and plans for establishing and
sustaining a Safety Management System (SMS), Environmental
Management System (EMS), Configuration Management System
(CMS), Quality Management System (QMS) and for producing the RTS
recommendation. Within the team there are the following
appointments:

11.4.1.1 Safety Manager. Maintain and implement the Safety and
Environmental Management Plan; manage development of the
required Safety Assessments and Environmental Case.

11.4.1.2 RTS Manager. Manage development of the REDACTED
supporting evidence required for T&E activity; manage development
of the RTS recommendation document and supporting evidence
pack.

11.4.1.3. Quality Assurance Manager. Develop and manage the
implementation of the Quality Assurance Plan.

11.4.1.4 Configuration and REDACTED. Manage and oversee
Configuration Management activities for the PROGRAMME
DELIVERABLE.
11.4.2 The PROGRAMME DT will meet its responsibilities for Occupational
Health, Safety and Environmental (OHS&E) management by complying
with the relevant safety plans and procedures. Occupational health,
safety and environmental (OHS&E) management for the project is in
accordance with DEPARTMENT NAME 1 policy. The Safety and
Environmental Governance structure for PROGRAMME is shown in the
figure below:

IMAGE

Figure 2: PROGRAMME Safety and Environmental
11.4.3 Technical Safety is covered within the PROGRAMME NAME Engineering
Management Plan.

11.5 Engineering and Safety Management

11.5.1 The Engineering function for PROGRAMME NAME is led by the Chief
Engineer (CE) / REDACTED The CE/ REDACTED is responsible for
the PROGRAMME System throughout its life from development to
disposal, as defined in XXX and expanded upon throughout the
REDACTED Regulatory Publications (RP). The responsibilities of the
CE/ REDACTED are detailed in the RP, and the programme specific
responsibilities of the PROGRAMME NAME CE/ REDACTED are detailed in
the PROGRAMME NAME Engineering Management Plan (EMP).

11.5.2 The EMP is the focal point document for all safety and engineering
activity associated with the project and is a living document that will
evolve during Acquisition, Operation through to Disposal of the
capability. This EMP predominately draws on the management of
safety and engineering activities identified in the Guide to Engineering
Activities and Reviews (GEAR) framework. The GEAR Review Record
supports the assessment of maturity of the GEAR products required,
as inputs and outputs dependent upon the level of maturity of the
engineering activity in each phase of the GEAR Cycle. This plan
reflects activity to take forward a single source procurement of a
PROGRAMME capability to FBC and beyond.

11.5.3 Whilst there is currently no specific policy regarding GEAR as applied
to the three-stage model of MAID, conclusions can be drawn from the
MAID documentation showing the relationship to the CADMID cycle,
which is common to both process models. The Strategic Outline Case
(SOC) aligns with the Pre-Concept phase, the Outline Business Case
(OBC) aligns with the end of the Concept Phase and Full Business
Case (FBC) aligns with the end of Assessment Phase. The mapping of
GEAR reviews to MAID and SUPPLIER’s process are outlined in Fig 3
- GEAR Approvals process aligned with MAID process and
SUPPLIER’s Approval process.

11.5.4 As the PROGRAMME NAME platform will be acquired predominantly ‘off-
the-shelf, there will be elements of the GEAR process that the project
will need/not need to undergo to reach the Manufacture Readiness
Review (MRR) Stage. The DT intends to have completed the MRR
stage for REDACTED and REDACTED by DATE and will require to
take the following steps in order to be able to reach this stage. The
MRR will incorporate threads from REDACTED Configuration Review
and tailoring for the REDACTED will be identified for each artefact.
11.5.5 The PROGRAMME DT is also following the TLB-Engineering
Standardisation Process Improvement Roll-Out Enforcement
{ACRONYM) processes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
the delivery of safety and CAPABILITY and ta enhance accountabilities
to the Duty Holder (DH) chain. ACRONYM recognises the DH owns all
threats with potential to cause harm 1st, 2nd, and 3rd parties and to
cause damage to the REDACTED. It is the CE/ REDACTED’s
responsibility to identify and correct equipment deficiencies to
overcome threats identified and to report residual risk to the DH.
ACRONYM provides the protocols and practices to implement and
facilitate an effective Safety Management System to conform to
regulations, instructions and policy. In some areas the required
artefacts identified by ACRONYM overlap with those identified within
GEAR, in the event of such occurrences the PROGRAMME NAME MK1 will
ordinarily apply precedence to ACRONYM. For example, GEAR
identifies of this requirement for a Software Acquisition Management
Plan (SwAMP} the DATs interpretation of this requirement for the TLB
is represented by the practise outlined in ACRONYM rather than those
outlined in GEAR.

11.5.6 GEAR will be applied where appropriate to the REDACTED
(REDACTED) elements although the incremental nature of the
contracts make for a challenge in setting boundaries for the GEAR
reviews. Each REDACTED element will undergo PDR and CDR and
sequencing and alignment of REDACTED elements and any
association with related REDACTED elements will also be an
engineering challenge. The REDACTED development was addressed
as a parallel issue to be covered under Tranche 2 amendment to the
contract (although some longer lead items and Training need analysis
were contracted under Tranche 1). A preliminary configuration review
was held in X DATE covering REDACTED as these are longer lead
items requiring sub-contract to industry outside SUPPLIER; the OFT
review also included details of a potential Part Task Trainer (PTT). A
second configuration review was held X DATE to cover any update to
OFT & VMT and for the remaining REDACTED elements (Distributed
Mission Trainer (DMT) and Operational Mission Simulator (OMS). A
final configuration review (FCR) was held in x DATE which equates to
an SRR.
11.5.7 Following review of the proposal for REDACTED Tranche 2 it was
decided that the VMT and PTT were rejected as options and that the
current proposal for the DMT and OMS would not be compliant with
JSP x. An alternative approach was mooted during the FCR that
discarded the DMT and entailed development of the OMS into a single
device (Distributed OMS (D-OMS)) that was JSP x compliant and could

be connected to DOTC(A).

11.5.8 The D-OMS solution provided by COMPANY presented too greater risk
in terms of performance and cost and was subsequently cancelled. The
REDACTED will be modified with PROGRAMME operator workstations
as a mitigating device for training PROGRAMME mission crews.

11.5.9 The PROGRAMME NAME DELIVERABLE project completed an SRR for
REDACTED, which was conducted in line with SUPPLIER standard
processes. The SRR set the formal high-level baseline configuration for
he DELIVERABLE. Prior to Final Configuration Reviews, the
PROGRAMME NAME DELIVERABLE completed a Tender Assessment
Review (TAR) for REDACTED, and a Technical Quality Audit (TQA) for
REDACTED.

11.5.10 It is the REDACTED’s intent for the type certification of the
PROGRAMME NAME DELIVERABLE to demonstrate compliance to the
Type Certification Basis in accordance with the Military System
Certification Process (MACP), whilst using existing certification
evidence from the original PROGRAMME NAME DELIVERABLE certification
with the desired outcome being the issue, by the REDACTED, of a
Military Type Certificate (MTC). The mission capability suite will also
include the capability to perform REDACTED roles. Due to the added
TLB Safety Risks associated with ATM the system also requires the
ATM equipment Release into Service Process (RiSP) and a tailored
approach to the RAx series and Def Stan 00-XXX are to be followed.

11.5.11 All of the key tasks and deliverables are detailed in the EMP. All
these activities will be led or supported by the engineering function,
largely using engineering function resource allocated to the DT.
However, for a few tasks, assurance resource will be required from
within the Support Operating Centre (OC) and OTHER PROGRAMME.
There is also a requirement for some external (non-MOD) support,
which will be captured on an external resource tab within the EMP
Workbook. Post FBC, there will be an increasing requirement for out-
sourced Independent Technical Evaluation (ITE). Note: There are
subordinate plans to the EMP but that they are detailed in the EMP.
The Document Hierarchy linking the PMP and EMP is shown below:
11.6

IMAGE

Security

11.6.1 The PROGRAMME NAME Security Management Plan (SMP) is a living

document that will be updated throughout the lifecycle of the Project.
This body of evidence will incorporate the plan and strategy that will be
adopted to manage all the security activities. During the Development
and Manufacturing Phase most security activities are planning and
preparation for the latter phases of the project. This includes resource
planning, identification of stakeholders and early engagement with
them. The Project has set up a Security Working Group (SWG) and
holds regular meetings. This group will contribute to security decision
making and act as advisors. Security activities will be managed in
accordance with DEPARTMENT NAME 1 and wider MOD security
policies in JSP x for managing security aspects and JSP x. Initially,
resources will be provided by the PROGRAMME NAME Delivery team,
Engineering and the ORGANISATION ROLE who is the security lead.

11.6.2 The capability has been procured on the “of-the-shelf’ principles

whereby the majority of the systems and equipment are of an extant
baseline design previously sold to other nations, the baseline line
design has therefore not been designed or assured to UK security
standards or requirements. In order to achieve assurance a risk-based
approach must be adopted whereby agreed baseline assurance issues
are identified and presented to the customer for ownership/action.

11.6.3 The above approach will mitigate and manage risks associated with

baseline elements where enough understanding of the as built baseline
products can be identified and assessed especially in the REDACTED
(REDACTED).

11.6.4 The AMS security documentation is being developed under the new

11.7

principles of Secure by Design (SbD) as laid out in JSP x. SbD will be
delivered for the PROGRAMME programme through an Engineering
Delivery Partner (EDP) project.

Support Solution Development

11.7.1 The Sustainment solution has been developed since DATE using

experience and examples from other UK fixed wing programmes
including OTHER PROGRAMME DELIVERABLE. The DEPARTMENT
NAME and PROGRAMME DT have been engaged with the
ORGANISATION and PROGRAMMEA System Programme Office at
LOCATION over several years to learn from their experience and
develop areas for co-operation. The UK Programme has benefited from
the ORGANISATION experience, which includes over X years of
operational output and capability sustainment.

11.7.2 Since the decision to relocate the DELIVERABLE fleet to

DEPARTMENT NAME LOCATION alongside OTHER PROGRAMME
DELIVERABLE, the support solution has been revised to be within the
same contract with COMPANY as OTHER PROGRAMME
DELIVERABLE to maximise efficiencies, opportunities, and coherence
between the fleets. The near-term intent is to create an overarching
combined OTHER PROGRAMME DELIVERABLE-DELIVERABLE
Through-Life Support Strategy, to develop a joint support system and
to align the associated COMPANY support contract.

11.7.3 The procurement strategy for DELIVERABLE Sustainment is to place a

11.8

single-source amendment to the extant OTHER PROGRAMME
DELIVERABLE and Training Support Provider contract with
COMPANY. Details of the sustainment contract can be found in the
Full Business Case.

Transition to Service

11.8.1 The Service Transition Plan will be overseen and directed by

11.9

ORGANISATION FHQ with the Business Change Manager at the
centre of its progress. The original plan looked at a seamless transition
from REDACTED to DELIVERABLE, the new plan will focus on the
introduction of DELIVERABLE at DEPARTMENT NAME LOCATION
and REDACTED to meet operational and other outputs. The
LOCATION Transition Team are the focal point for Business Change
at DEPARTMENT NAME LOCATION and as such are already heavily
engaged with stakeholders and in the provision of integration
workshops.

Specific Considerations

11.9.1 Legal Considerations. The PROGRAMME procurement is excluded

from the Defence and Security Public Contract Regulations 2011
(DSPCR) under Regulation 7° due to the requirement for the provider
to access nationally sensitive information. This exclusion was
authorised by the Directorate of Security and Resilience in x DATE.
The single-source procurement strategy is justified for technical
reasons and intellectual property rights (IPR) restrictions. A Voluntary
Transparency Notice, endorsed by MOD Legal Advisors, was
published in x DATE without challenge. The A&TSP contract was
subject to external legal review prior to award in DATE and the external
legal advisors are providing support to negotiations for the
DELIVERABLE sustainment amendment.

11.9.2 Government Funded Assets (GFA). GFA are items that the Authority
need to provide to a COMPANY for use on a Government contract.
The Obligations Matrix provides information on the GFA requirements
that the MoD are required to supply to SUPPLIER. Failure to meet the
GFA dependencies detailed in the contract and detailed in the
obligation’s matrix may give rise to a Delay Event, allowing for Time
and/or Money (depending on the circumstance) against their above-
mentioned obligations.

11.9.3 Technical Assistance Agreement (REDACTED). Provision of certain
technical data, hardware and other services are restricted by the
REDACTED (REDACTED). Authorisation for SUPPLIER to export
REDACTED controlled items under this contract, are governed by
REDACTED. Any items received which are restricted under
REDACTED must only be disclosed as allowed under the
REDACTED.

12 Governance and Organisation
12.1 Programme Lifecycle

12.1.1 The PROGRAMME Programme is currently in the Manufacture Phase
of the CADMID cycle:

12.1.2 A summary of the PROGRAMME manufacture phase delivery
schedule is detailed in Annex C.

12.2 Delivery Assurance

12.2.1 The Integrated Approvals and Assurance plan (IAAP) and the Specific
Evidence Table (SET) has been endorsed by Defence Portfolio and
Approvals Secretariat (DPAS) and Scrutiny respectively and
demonstrates that the programme continues to engage in all mandated
Governance, Approvals and Assurance activities including Programme
Boards, Assessment Gates and Information notes. The PROGRAMME
NAME Programme adheres to the Project Management Control
Framework (PMCF). All mandated programme artefacts required are
referenced in the Programme Definition Document (PDD).

12.3 Governance Boards and Key Meetings

12.3.1 The PROGRAMME NAME Programme is governed by a Programme Board
cycle that runs 3 times per year, facilitated by the ORGANISATION
PMO and aligned with the other TLB Programmes cycle. Prior to each
Programme Board cycle the PROGRAMME NAME Programme shall run a
Programme Working Group (WG) meeting at which the Programme
Mgr will report Programme delivery confidence to the Programme Dir,
including any risks or issues affecting performance, cost or time. At the
Programme Board, the Programme Dir will report delivery confidence
to the SRO. The TLB Cap Delivery REDACTED Programmes
Management Strategy sets out the detail of the programme board
cycle, including responsibilities and attendance at each event.

12.3.2 Regular governance meetings are held between the Primary
COMPANY and the Programme Board. These include the Monthly
Programme Review (MPR) and the quarterly Executive Programme
Management Review (EPMR)}.

12.3.3 Meetings, where required, will produce minutes to record decisions
taken and actions agreed. These are distributed to attendees and
relevant governance forums and placed in the project history/action log
for ongoing reference and audit purposes. Regular PROGRAMME

12.7.2.1

Programme communication themes, objectives and key events

and are captured in the PROGRAMME NAME Communications Plan‘.

12.7.3 Review
12.7.3.1 The stakeholder list will be regularly reviewed and kept up to
date. A Core Script has been developed within the Programme
Media & Communications Plan and is regularly reviewed to provide
key messages, lines to take and information on the programme to

inform MOD stakeholders and press office when dealing with media
and industry.

12.8 Learning from Experience and Knowledge Management

12.8.1 Learning from Experience (LfE) is an essential element of project

management, which allows organisational learning by replicating
successes, avoiding mistakes, and publicising and promoting good
practice. The ORGANISATION Quality Assurance and LfE strategy
document details the responsibilities of all personnel invalved in the
learning and exploitation of lessons to aid future planning and better
programme management. It states why, by whom, how and when
lessons should be submitted and is aligned to the principles of the TLB
Portfolio Office (PfO) LfE Strategy.

12.8.2 LfE reviews will be undertaken at appropriate intervals during the

project life to implement the lessons gained. LfE will also be exchanged
with TLB Command as appropriate. Lessons identified are captured in
he ORGANISATION Lessons Register. DT stakeholders are to submit
lessons identified using the OTHER PROGRAMME capture form to
OTHER PROGRAMME HPMO1 EMAIL.

12.8.3 The following 5-step approach to LfE will be used to ensure lessons
are identified, captured, analysed, shared and implemented:

IMAGE

Figure 6: PROGRAMME Programme LfE process.

12.8.4 The PROGRAMME DT have identified the following lessons to be
considered and utilised from other major programmes:

12.8.4.1 Allied platform upgrade Programmes. Both REDACTED and
REDACTED have undergone recent upgrade Programmes in
capabilities very similar to REDACTED. The DT has sought
experiences from these Programmes.

12.8.4.2. REDACTED. This team, funded through an extant FMS case,
has provided valuable insight into the costs and schedules of
comparable Programmes.

12.8.4.3 Infrastructure upgrade for the PROJECT project at
DEPARTMENT NAME LOCATION had similar programme
12.9

requirements.

Information Management

12.9.1 Effective information management across the DT is enabled through

use of Microsoft (MS} Teams and SharePoint. MS Teams serves as a
hub for real-time communication and collaboration, enabling the DT to
chat, meet and co-author documents. SharePoint compliments this by
providing a secure and organised document management system. The
DT can access, share and collaborate on SharePoint libraries directly
through the MS Teams interface.

12.9.2 All key management, approval, planning and strategy documents are

additionally stored within the HQ PROGRAMME SharePoint site. When
documents are no longer being worked, they will be either deleted or
filed as a record in accordance with MOD Policy. Please refer to the

PROGRAMME Information Management Plan for additional information.

13 Monitoring and Control

13.1

Change Control

13.1.1 PROGRAMME programme change management is a key element of

Project Controls (PC) as it ensures a consistent, controlled and
assured approach involving all key stakeholders and incorporates
internal business case approvals. The change management process is
held on the SYSTEM with the responsibility of identifying, raising,
approving, assuring and implementing change management requests
falling to all functional areas as appropriate.

13.1.2 The Project Management Baseline will only be amended via the use of

13.2

the PROGRAMME change management process and completion of the
appropriate Baseline Change Request (BCR) form. The scheduler will
liaise with the Project Manager (PM) or/and Control Account Manager
(CAM) and others in the development and maintenance of a resource-
loaded baseline schedule. The baseline schedule will only be adjusted
with an approved BCR. The resource-loaded baseline schedule will be
used as the basis for the EVM plan or Budgeted Costs of Work
Scheduled (BCWS).

Schedule Control

13.2.1 An integral part of successful Programme delivery is the development

and agreement of the schedule. The schedule should combine the
efforts required from DEPARTMENT NAME 1 to deliver the
programme, as well as a summary of the delivery schedule produced
by the supplier. The Project Controls Scheduler verifies and validates
the supplier schedule against the contract requirement. We expect the
supplier to produce a summary schedule which we then integrate into
our Integrated Master Schedule (IMS). If the programme has
dependencies upon other projects in DELIVERY PARTNER, then a
condensed view of the dependent schedule will also need to be
integrated into the IMS. For audit purposes, all the estimated durations
from the IMS are recorded in a schedule data and assumptions list
{SDAL) along with any global assumptions applied to the schedule
such as: non-working periods, hours in a working day, etc.

13.2.2 Once the IMS has been created, it is output-assured by Project
Controls against a checklist intended to assess the technical structure
of the schedule. Once the schedule has been resource-loaded with one
of the generic resource profiles, it is used to generate the staffing plan
for the programme, which is used as a demand signal for assignments
to be filled.

13.2.3 The programme schedule is contained in SCHEDULE SOFTWARE
and managed as follows:

13.2.3.1. The DEPARTMENT NAME 1 Project Scheduler will liaise with
relevant personnel (including COMPANYs and other staff external
to the DT) monthly to determine progress of tasks against the
schedule to update the current schedule. The PM is responsible for
ensuring a monthly drumbeat meeting takes place prior to the ‘Bl
Analytics’ Cost Performance Reporting (CPR) deadline. Once the
drumbeat has taken place and the project position has been
agreed, the PM is responsible for completing the CPR variance
analysis in line with the TLB Chief Operating Officers (COO)
timetable as notified by the PCM in BI Analytics.

13.2.3.2 CPR variance explanations are to use the format of Cause,
Impact, resolution for those variances that have a Schedule
Performance and Cost Performance Indicator (SPI/CPI) variance
that is outside of DT tolerance levels of +/-10%. Explanations are
required for current period, cumulative and at-completion values
and should be forward looking not just historical.

13.2.3.3 The schedule details the project milestones as set out in the
CASP. Schedule Risk Analysis will be used to determine risk
adjusted 10%, 50% and 90% confidence figures for each milestone
and CASP milestones will be reviewed by the PROGRAMME Team
Leader monthly. The PM is responsible for ensuring that CPR
variance analysis explanations includes pre-warning if a CASP
milestone is at risk.

13.3 Cost Control
13.3.1 Cost Control activity will be undertaken in accordance with MOD’s

Financial Management and in DEPARTMENT NAME 1 instructions,
guidance and timetables published by DEPARTMENT NAME 1
Resources.

13.3.2 PROGRAMME programme funding will be provided by TLB Cmd,
established through the Annual Budget Cycle (ABC) process and
reviewed biannually through the Project Cost Review (PCR) process.
The In-Year forecast and programme actual expenditure will be
reviewed monthly utilising the Cost Coherency Tool (CCT) until the roll-
out of P3M release 4 which will incorporate cost into the same
mandated PC toolset. Performance against Control Totals (CT) is
monitored through monthly cost.

13.3.3 As costs are incurred, they are recorded in the FINANCE TOOL and
are then fed into the project's P3M cost engine tool, OTHER
SOFTWARE. The costs incurred by DEPARTMENT NAME 1 staff are
extracted from the time-bookings for the PROGRAMME programme in
the period, held in the P3M tool. The project controls cost controller
scrutinises the costs incurred to date and gathers evidence for work
currently in progress. They then determine what value of work should
be added to the project's accruals for the ‘non-receipted’ work in
progress (WIP). The value of this work and the associated evidence is
passed over to the finance and accounting function so that the project
monthly accruals can be added to the general ledger. Discrepancies
between the P3M tool and the general ledger are investigated and the
P3M tool amended before the cost data is ready for variance analysis.

13.4 Risk Management

13.4.1 The risk management procedure can be found via the following
SYSTEM link: LINK . The RACI matrix shows who holds responsibility
for risk management within the project.

13.4.2 Project threat and opportunity information is held in the SOFTWARE
NAME database. The following scoring schemes are used in
SOFTWARE NAME:

13.4.2.1 For acquisition: Cat A Acquisition - SOFTWARE NAME.
13.4.2.2. For in-service: NEW In Service Support AB.

13.4.3 The Risk Manager conducts a monthly drumbeat review of each risk in
the PROGRAMME programme risk register with the respective risk
owners. Quarterly risk reviews chaired by the Team Leader, facilitated
by the Risk Manager and attended by all team members are required.

13.4.4 Risk management documentation including policies, procedures, desk
instructions and guidance can be accessed through the SYSTEM or
through the DEPARTMENT NAME 1 Risk Community Portal on
Sharepoint.
13.4.4.1. SYSTEM link: LINK
13.4.4.2. Risk Community Portal: LINK

13.4.5 The Project Delivery Learning & Development Hub provides details of
the risk discipline training which is currently available. Training courses
can be booked via MyHR which requires approval by DM & FDO.

13.4.6 Project Controls Foundation Skills (PCFS) training is a series of E-
Learning modules providing an awareness level of training on the
different Project Controls sub disciplines. Risk Management is module
5 and is now available through the Defence Learning Environment.

13.4.6.1 Risk Training link: LINK

13.4.7 Risk ownership is delegated to the best person to manage. Generally,
the CAMs are the owners of the risks, however the best person to
manage is decided initially during risk identification and reviewed in
further risk reviews.

13.4.8 If a risk cannot be managed by the DT, then it will require escalating.
The decision for this process lies with the Team Leader. All high and
very high-level risks (based on target score) will be reviewed for
escalation during the Team Leader level risk review. Escalation will be
considered if:

13.4.8.1 There is a perceived likelihood of cross-business influence
outside of current delivery area.

13.4.8.2 Required actions fall to a higher level of responsibility.

13.4.9 Management Reserve (MR) for the PROGRAMME programme is
determined utilising the risk data held in SOFTWARE NAME and
provided to cost control to enable profiling for In-Year management and
PCR MR reporting.

13.4.10 Customer Risk Management is held on a quarterly basis by TLB
Command via a pan DLOD risk review, to which the DT are invited to
attend. The DT will review any actions required prior to this risk review
and send relevant DEPARTMENT NAME 1 representation. Should
there be any risk(s) that are better managed by DEPARTMENT NAME
1 this will be proposed during the risk review and then sanctioned in
the monthly DT risk review.

13.4.11 The management of Risk, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies
and Opportunities (RAIDO) is documented in the MOD Risk
Management Policy JSP x and DEPARTMENT NAME 1 risk
management policy.
13.5 Issue and Opportunity Management

13.5.1 Issue and Opportunity Management is linked to the Risk Process and
captured on SOFTWARE NAME.

13.5.2 The Master Data and Assumptions List (MDAL) and Third Order
Assumptions (OAs) are used to record all assumptions that underpin
and affect PROGRAMME project. The MDAL is to be reviewed
quarterly by the DT and the 30As are to be reviewed annually by the
DT Requirements Manager RM as part of the ABC process.

13.5.3 The project dependencies are recorded in the MDAL and managed
primarily through Internal Business Agreements (IBA) and commercial
contracts. Dependencies that are required by a specific date are
included in the schedule and are monitored by the project scheduler.

13.5.4 The delivery of Efficiencies and Benefits has been managed through
the DEPARTMENT NAME 1 Benefits Management Application (BMA).
The following key benefits have been recorded for the PROGRAMME

13.6 Supplier and Contract Management

13.6.1 The Contract Management Plan (CMP) is the key reference document
for contract management. It provides details of the approach to
managing the UK PROGRAMME Acquisition Contract throughout its
Period of Performance (PoP). During the contract, the CMP will be a
day-to-day management handbook. It provides details including who
does what, when and how under the contract.
13.6.2 The CMP is an evolving document and will be updated throughout the
life of the contract. It does not replace the contract (which always has

primacy) and the CMP itself has no contractual status. The CMP is the

13.7 Quality Management

13.7.1 PROGRAMME programme quality and assurance is conducted in
accordance with MOD policy JSP and will comply with the TLB Quality
and Assurance Strategy.

13.7.2 Quality management in the PROGRAMME programme ensures that
stakeholders are satisfied that the planned benefits have the best
chance of being realised and programme objectives will be met. It is
about identifying the right things to do and doing them correctly. It is
principally focused on process effectiveness which is set out in the
programme governance strategies, alignment with the TLB Command
Plan and confirmation that the programme will meet defined benefits
and endorsed user requirements.

13.7.3 PROGRAMME programme assurance will take place to provide the
SRO and other stakeholders, including the Investment Approvals
Committee, with confidence that the programme is on track to meet its
objectives.

13.7.4 Assurance activities will be focused on areas of highest risk to
programme success and are coordinated to support decision-making
and inform investment approvals, while avoiding duplication of activities
that do not add value. Assurance activities will be recorded on the
PROGRAMME programme’s Integrated Assurance and Approvals Plan
{IAAP}, which will be maintained to cover as a minimum, the current
and following two financial years.

EVALUATION AND CLOSURE

14 Evaluation

141 The PROGRAMME programme evaluation and acceptance process is
detailed in the Integrated Test, Evaluation and Acceptance Plan (ITEAP). The
ITEAP is owned and maintained by TLB Cap via the Requirements Managers.
14.2 The ITEAP outlines the general approach to be taken by the
PROGRAMME programme and bound the activities required to satisfy the
following structured arguments:

14.2.1 Structured Argument 1 (SA‘1): the DELIVERABLE Systems will be
Safe to Operate and Operated Safely.

14.2.2 Structured Argument 2 (SA2): the DELIVERABLE Capability will be
REDACTED.

14.2.3 Structured Argument 3 (SA3): the DELIVERABLE Systems will be
Contractually Acceptable.

14.3 The status of each of the structured arguments will be measured at
each capability milestone (e.g., Introduction to Service, Initial Operating
Capability and Full Operating Capability) and are expected to require
consideration from a pan-DLOD perspective (see Figure 7). The ITEA activity
will ultimately underpin arguments that the programme KURs and hence
approved business case has been met.
