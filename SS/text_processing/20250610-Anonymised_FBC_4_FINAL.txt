NAME OF PROJECT  – FULL BUSINESS CASE (CATEGORY C ) 
Executive Summary  
1. This Business Case seeks approval to enter the Demonstration and Manufacture phases of 
the NAME OF PROJECT  project  with the preferred tenderer, selected as a result of a competition 
held to the Competitive Negotiated procedure within  Defence and Security Public Contract 
Negotiation  (DSPCR ) following Initial Gate Business Case (IGBC) approval  in DATE1. 
2. The project will  replace REDACTED with DELIVERABLES . These will  fully meet the User 
Requirements and th erefore  enable CUSTOMER  to continue to provide REDACTED around  
LOCATIONS  thus delivering D efence  Task s. The replacement will consist of NUMBER OF  
replacement DELIVERABLES  in UK LOCATIONS  (including NUMBER  as a funded contractual 
option) and NUMBER  replacement DELIVERABLES  for LOCATION .  
3. The Project Cost of £ XXXX is considered to offer Value for Money, demonstrated by 
the successful conclusion of the competition resulting in the selection of a Preferred 
Tenderer in accordance with the Most Economically Advantageous  Tender (MEAT) criteria.  
4. The procurement strategy does not include  Resource Delivery ( RDEL ) in-service support; 
instead support will be provided via the extant DELIVERABLES  In-Service Support (ISS) contract 
and follow -on contracts.  
5. DELIVERABLE  1 is due to be accepted off contract  by DATE,  contributing to the 
declaration of an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) by  DATE . DELIVERABLE  NUMBER is due 
to be accepted off contract by DATE , with Full Operational Capability (FOC) being achieved by  
DATE . 
Issue  
6. This Full Business Case seeks a pproval  from the ORGANISATION  Approvals Committee to 
award a contract to the Preferred Tenderer in order to commence the  Demonstration and 
Manufacture phase of the Police Patrol DELIVERABLE  project . 
Timing  
7. Routine. FBC Approval is requested by DATE to allow Contract Award by DATE , which is 
in-line with Tenderer's expectations and hence minimises the risk of delay to DELIVERABLE  
delivery which could  be caused by a delay to Contract Award.  
Recommendation  
8. The Approving Authority  is invited to approve : 
a.     The NAME OF PROJECT  project proceeding to the Demonstration and Manufacture 
phases with COMPANY ; 
b.     The Key User Requirements (KURs) at Annex A;  
 
  c.     The Approved Budgetary Level (outturn, inclusive  of all non -recoverable VAT) at  50% 
confidence for the Demonstration  and Manufacture  phases  of £XXXX  consisting  of:

Presentation and Handling  
10. The DELIVERABLES  PT are working with the NAME OF OTHER DEPARTMENT  
Corporate Communications Team to develop a Press and Publicity Strategy which will be in place 
by Contract Award. There is not expected to be significant interest in the contract announcement 
outside specialist press and local media in LOCATION . 
11. The preferred Tenderer is a small to medium enterprise (SME) based in LOCATION , and 
has sub -contract relationships with other UK -based suppliers including COMPANIES . Therefore 
the majority of the work to be conducted via this contract award will be retained within the UK.  
Case Narrative - Strategic Case  
12. The NAME OF PROJECT  Project seeks to continue the enduring requirement for NAME 
OF DEPARTMENT  to deliver ongoing CAPABILITY  at the NUMBER  UK LOCATIONS  
(LOCATION , LOCATION 1  and LOCATION 2 ), LOCATION  and NAME OF COUNTRY Sovereign 
Base Area ( SBA).3 This requirement directly derives from  the Defence Task to REDACTED.   
13. In addition, NAME OF DEPARTMENT  have an enduring requirement to provide 
REDACTED . 
14. Finally, NAME OF DEPARTMENT  are also responsible to REDACTED.  
15. In order to deliver these requirements, NAME OF DEPARTMENT  require for the provision 
of REDACTED .  
16. The requirement  is currently delivered by REDACTED , of which NUMBER  were originally 
built between YEAR – YEAR  and NUMBER  between  YEAR  – YEAR . Therefore t hese NUMBER  
DELIVERABLES  are all , despite successful mid -life upgrades, either  at or beyond the end of their 
useful service life.  
 
 
  17. In order to ensure unbroken delivery of the capability requirement , the NAME OF 
PROJECT  project will deliver:  
a.     NUMBER replacement DELIVERABLES  for NAME OF DEPARTMENT  in UK 
LOCATIONS  (including  NUMBER  as a funded contractual option);  
b.     NUMBER  replacement DELIVERABLES  for LOCATION  (funded contractual option);  
18. The contractual option for NUMBER  DELIVERABLES  exists because those 
DELIVERABLES  were not funded at the time the competition was started. As funding for those 
DELIVERABLES  has now been secured  (through re -profiling of the entire DELIVERABLES  
Acquisition portfolio) , uptake of the option is expected soon after commencement of the contract.  
19. There remains an additional contract option for NUMBER  replacement DELIVERABLES  for 
COUNTRY . These DELIVERABLES  are currently unfunded and as such do not form part of this 
approval. However, previous discussions have suggested that NAME OF OTHER 
DEPARTMENT 2  have aspirations to upgrade CAPABILITY  of COUNTRY  in a similar manner to 
LOCATION ; these contractual options allow those aspirations to be realised without undertaking 
additional procurement action should appropriate direction and funding be forthcoming. Further 
approval will be sought via a Review Note to this approval should consideration be given to taking 
up this option in future.  
Case Narrative - Economic Case  
20. The IGBC concluded that the option which would be most likely to provide Value for Money 
was to "replace with new DELIVERABLE ". This decision was taken as it:  
"allows for new DELIVERABLE  to be purchased, allowing the current aged and already extended 
DELIVERABLE  to be removed from service. It will meet the user’s tasking and  will provide the 
more efficient through life maintenance by reducing variants."  
21. The Procurement  and Commercial Strateg y recommended that this be achieved through 
engagement in open competition with industry to select a preferred bidder. This competition has 
henceforth been completed using the Competitive Negotiated procedure under the DSPCR 
YEAR regulations, resulting in the receipt of 2 tenders.  
22. In order to ensure the selection of the tender which offered the greatest Value for Money, 
the Most Economically Advantageous (MEAT) evaluation methodology was followed with the 
following weightings assigned:  
a. Technical (55.5%);  
b. Cost (40%);  
c. Supportability (4.5%).  
The NAME OF TEAM Team, following  consultation with CAAS, consider that the MEAT approach 
used to assess returned tenders is largely analogous  to establishing Value for Money.   
23. It should be noted that in -service support  funding is not included within the scope of this 
procurement  (except the £ XXXX , referred to in Para 9d, which is forms part of this approval) ; 
instead support will be provided via the extant ISS contract s and follow -on contracts.  This 
decision was made as learning from experience  across  the DELIVERABLES  Acquisition and In -
Service Support Programme shows that V alue for Money  is obtained for non -complex 
DELIVERABLES  to a commercial design by purchasing without ISS.  This allows specialist in -
service support providers to provide a more focussed support solution, including avoiding the 
duplication of on -site support provision for 1st and 2nd level maintenance  which will be conducted 
by the support contractor on behalf of NAME OF DEPARTMENT  for all their DELIVERABLES . It  also allows a more competitive procurement process as it gives the opportunity for commercial 
DELIVERABLE  builders (who have no intrinsic support capability) to tender.  
24. In addition, a VfM opportunity has been taken prior to FBC endorsement. The project was 
initially seeking to combine multiple DELIVERABLE  variants in to one; through Requirements 
reviews and industry engagement, doubt was expressed that this strategy would deliver  VfM. By 
splitting the project into two variants  a lower average unit cost was achieved . As a result, a 
portion of the initial project funding was reallocated to the DELIVERABLE  project , and further 
efficiencies were reallocated across the DELIVERA BLES  Acquisition programme.  
Case Narrative - Financial Case  
25. The Approved Budgetary Level (ABL) being sought within this approval (outturn, inclusive 
of all non -recoverable VAT at 50% confidence) for  Manufacture  consist s of: 
a.     £XXXX  total resource consumption (RDEL)  
b.     £XXXX  capital expenditure (CDEL)  
26. This is in addition to the in-service support provision approved as part of the ISS MGBC  
ORGANISATION  Allocation (£XXXX  RDEL; £ XXXX  CDE L and £ XXXX  RMC ). Of this approval, 
approximately £ XXXX  was allocated to NAME OF PROJECT  within the Cost Models.  
27. The ISS MGBC approved in -service support provision until DATE . Approval for NAME OF 
PROJECT  in-service support beyond this date will be incorporated into the approval for ISS 
follow -on arrangements.  
28. Affordability of the project is demonstrated in the table below , overall affordability within the

Table 4 - Cost and Affordability Table  
29. The project is affordable in Near Cash terms. There are minor discrepancies  in DEL 
provision during FY  YEARS  and YEARS , primarily  caused by the preferred tenderer front -loading 
design and tooling costs onto the UPC of DELIVERABLE  1. Despite the existence of a net -
present value calculation in the tender, the outcome of the competition was not affected by this 
position. FY YEARS shows a variance , prior to the RDEL transfer,  of £XXXX  and FY  YEARS 
shows a variance , prior to the RDEL transfer  of £XXXX . This affordability  issued will be 
addressed through a RDEL  to CDEL transfer, which will be actioned within PCR  DATE  costing.   
 
30.  All RDEL cost s for ISS  are out -of-scope of  this approval, as NAME OF PROJECT  Support 
Costs are affordable within the current scope of the I SS contract  and approval as demonstrated 
by the t able below . In-service support provision beyond FY  YEARS (italicised and marked with an 
asterisk in the table) will be included within the approval for follow -on support contracts.

32. The correct VAT and accounting treatment applications have been  applied and  have been  
assured by REDACTED . 
33. NAME OF OTHER DEAPARTMENT  have confirmed that there are no contingent liabilities . 
34. There is no Private Sector Support (PSS) expenditure associated with this approval.  
35. Raw Materials and Consumables (RMC) expendi ture will be apportioned from the value 
approved in the ISS MGBC, as these DELIVERABLES  will be directly replacing platforms for 
which RMC expenditure was included for the full duration of that approval. It is not anticipated 
that there will be either notable savings or uplift to the planned RMC expenditure compared to the 
assumptions made under that approval.  
Case Narrative - Commercial Case  
36. This procurement fell within the scope of the Defence & Security Public Contracts 
Regulations YEAR  (DSPCR YEAR ).  To allow for face to face discussions and clarifications of 
each tenderer’s proposal, the Competitive Negotiated procedure (under DSPCR YEAR ) was 
utilised.   
37. In order to best achieve the required capability within funding constraints, the contract 
contained a well -defined firm requirement for  NUMBER  NAME OF PROJECT  plus a further 
NUMBER option DELIVERABLES . It is the DELIVERABLES  Team's intention to take up the 
option for the first NUMBER additional DELIVERABLE  soon after commencement of the 
contract.   The contract will be awarded on a Firm Price basis for all requirements due for delivery 
in Years YEAR  - YEAR  of the contract (FY  YEARS until FY  YEARS ), with requirements in 
subsequent years subject to a Fixed Price with a Variation of Price (VOP) clause linked to the 
K8ZU price index, as agreed with Defence Economics.  
38. Payment will be made via Contracting, Purchasing & Finance (CP&F) upon delivery of 
individual DELIVERABLES , spares packages and other contractual 
deliverables.  Milestone  payments will also be defined within the contract and will be made to 
cover work completed to the satisfaction of the MOD during the design and manufacture phases.  
39. Suitable Intellectual Property (IP) DEFCONs have been included in the contract to enable 
any contractor nominated by the Authority to carry out future support.   
40.  The contract is DEFCON based with narrative conditions.   
41. The Contractor is not classified as Strategic Supplier; therefore the Cabinet Office 
Commercial spend process is not required to be followed.

Table 6 – 3 Point Estimation  of NAME OF PROJECT  Milestones  
43. IOC and FOC are defined at Annex D.  
44. The NAME OF PROJECT  programme is currently fully resourced as it remains one of the 
higher -priority projects within the DELIVERABLES  Acquisition Programme. Meanwhile, other 
projects (notably those where procurement action has not yet started,  and which are deemed 
lower priority by the Customer) are not progressing because the team’s resource is focussed on 
these higher -priority projects.  
45. The principal risks to delivery are outlined below , with further detail at Annex  B: 
a.     There is a risk that design changes post -Contract Award (due to either a 
misinterpretation of the requirement, or a change in the User Requirement)  will result in 
cost increases and/or time delays as the contractual requirement is amend ed. As 
always, these changes have the least impact early in the design phase but are still likely 
to have some financial implications. The risk will be mitigated b y regular engagement 
with CUSTOMER  stakeholders  including Design Workshops post -Contract Award , 
ensuring ‘buy -in’ of stakeholders . 
b.     There is a risk that it is not possible to agree a price with the support contractor. 
When negotiating with the support contractor the principles of NAPNOC (No Acceptable 
Price, No Contract) will apply in order to ensure VfM is obtained and that the proposal is 
commercially acceptable.  In addition to this, we will seek a price for the support of 
NAME OF PROJECT  from both the ISS Lot 3  (CUSTOMER ) and Lot 1  (Overseas)  
contractors, COMPANY and COMPANY  respectively, which will allow comparative price 
analysis to be completed and further support negotiations.  If it is not possible to reach 
agreement on the pricing of the support contract,  then fallback arrangements will be 
enacted. This could involve either the placing of in -service support with another of the 
ISS contractors or  holding a further competition specifically for the in -service support of 
these DELIVERABLES . The risk will be mitigated by ensuring that sufficient time is 
allowed in the negotiat ion schedule to allow t fallback plans to be enacted should the 
need arise .
