1. PURPOSE
The Buyer seeks to procure a Supplier with demonstrable experience and expertise in holographic AI-driven project management solutions to design, develop, and deploy a Holographic Project Office (HPO). The HPO will provide real-time project monitoring and control using AI-driven decision support systems, live feeds of project data, and immersive visualizations. The Supplier will work collaboratively with the Buyer to ensure the solution meets all operational, security, and performance requirements.
2. BACKGROUND TO THE BUYER
The Buyer operates within Nova Britannia, a recently formed nation of 1.5 million people that gained independence from a union of nations. As part of the independence agreement, Nova Britannia secured a $45 billion settlement over 10 years to fund infrastructure and service transformation projects. The goal of this funding is to establish economic and environmental sustainability while reducing dependencies on its former union.
Nova Britannia is undergoing rapid development, investing in digital transformation, green energy, and modern infrastructure to secure its future prosperity. As part of this effort, the government is implementing innovative project management solutions to ensure that all investments are efficiently managed, transparent, and deliver long-term value.
The Buyer is responsible for overseeing strategic national projects, ensuring that all initiatives align with Nova Britannia’s vision of becoming a self-sufficient, technologically advanced, and environmentally responsible nation.
