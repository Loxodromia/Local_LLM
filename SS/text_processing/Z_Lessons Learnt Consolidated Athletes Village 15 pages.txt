Plan early the strategy and sequencing of external works

Avoid chasing milestones to the detriment of the long-term goal, and
remember to deal with the communal areas and building envelopes as well
as apartments

Ensure change control process is understood by whole team

Ensure there is a clear strategy to take the project from development / design
stage to construction

Hold monthly project site team meetings to help clarify site-wide and
individual building design / scope interfaces, and focus on key issues

" Make clear ‘contract status’ scopes available to all team members to avoid
confusion

Agree frame type and crane strategy early to inform design programme

Reduce hoist periods to minimise costs

Use precast columns and walls and use pan system (saving time)

Form podium slab early as it allows early M&E installation and provides covered
storage and work areas

Start roofing works as early as possible, avoiding temporary waterproofing — buy
multiple visits to enable this and involve M&E early so that penetrations are done
in time

Post-fix cladding instead of using cast-in channels as they are never 100% right
Maximise window pre-fabrication and installation in cladding panels

Buy a temporary facade wall with the frame contractor to double up edge
protection and get watertight to enable fit-out to commence

Incorporate a temporary waterproof detail at facade joints

Recruitment and retention of suitably skilled managers (with residential
experience) at the appropriate time is critical

Lend Lease

Use incentives to retain key personnel until completion

Clearly set-out roles and responsibilities, review regularly and update to
address changing roles and changes in teams - maintain clear
organograms

Infrastructure connections to buildings must be coordinated with plot
programmes to ensure main services (including security and district
heating) are available when required and that external works do not clash
with fagade works (i.e. service trenches not in way of or delayed by
scaffolding)

Have the right resources at the right time to adjust Cost Planning and
check design evolution internally, ensuring all interface issues are
identified - consider aligning commercial close-out strategy with building
handover processes

Consider sliding scale of risk / reward from incentivisation through to
damages

Finalised design assists with procurement — however there are also
considerable advantages in getting subcontractor involvement early to inform
design decisions, so this needs to be carefully considered and a suitable
balance agreed between design finalisation for cost certainty and design
flexibility for cost and buildability improvements

Ensure procurement process is fully incorporated into an overall design,
procurement, construction and handover programme

Insist on a detailed design programme from relevant subcontractors (and
make condition of first payment)

Consider combining sub and superstructure packages, to avoid costs associated
with interfaces and handover from one to the other

Procure windows and other interfacing cladding systems at the same time

Separate installer from manufacturer of pods to increase number of possible
companies — consider positioning by drylining subcontractor

Get each subcontractor to undertake a buildability review and issue a
confirmation statement, as part of their contract

Ensure any additional visits for items affected by interfaces with other
subcontractors are bought with the package initially, assisted by an
interface matrix

Use milestone payments instead of monthly ones for consultants as well
as subcontractors

Check design, manufacturing and installation capacity of each supplier

(possibly on multiple buildings / site-wide) and effect it could have on lead-

in periods, and have a strategy to deal with any delays
Only let items of work that are within a subcontractors’ expertise

Coordinate site-wide and individual building procurement to eliminate
scope gaps and ensure clarity on delivery requirements for all areas

Give design teams a high level design programme and get them to
produce their own detailed programme to fit it — they will have buy-in to meet
their own programme, and should resource accordingly (include allowance for
reviewing design team and subcontractor drawings)

Issue fullest possible design brief before design commences to incorporate
all requirements including those for temporary Games use (both Olympics and
Paralympics) and sustainability issues, and then freeze the design as early as
possible

Changes, including variations to the design brief and any Value
Engineering, must consider the effect on the design team, subcontractor
and construction resources and programmes as well as cost before being
incorporated (thoroughly review all issues including effect on interfaces and
building services) — consider the potentially very large number of apartments
and therefore drawings that might be affected

The Change Control process needs to be streamlined and to have
authority for sign-off of contingency release delegated to an identified
appropriate level, but with central control to ensure coordinated responses to
Dls with consideration of brief, programme and priorities

Ensure appropriate lessons learnt from relevant buildings / projects are
captured by the project team at the earliest and appropriate times to effect
useful learning

Appoint consultants competent to carry out the design and coordination

Lead design coordination role to be clear and enforced, including
coordination in other disciplines, especially MEP

Ensure adequate level of Design Manager and Package Manager resource
to check drawings

Use different design practices to give design diversity

Clarify the role, authority and specific requirements of the Client
rxdlonitoring Team (CMT), and have a clear recorded communication
process

Standardise site-wide detailing where possible (e.g. balconies, dry-lining),
but must be prepared properly and enable flexibility to suit each project including
allowing for different suppliers (e.g. BG and Lafarge) — make the project
architect responsible, with detailed subcontract design where appropriate

Standardise MEP design and equipment site-wide as far as possible

issue a tough brief at the beginning and integrate balconies into the facade to
avoid / reduce water / fire / thermal issues at connections

Toilet and bathroom pods good with maximisation of repetition — ability to freeze
design (including finishes) early is essential

Back-to-back pods are significantly slower to sequence and test than single
pods — access to stacks and other plumbing is the key issue, so do not overlook
it or use inappropriate materials for access panels, and ensure stacks, valves
and rodding points are easily accessible

Consider locating cooling units above the bathroom pods instead of in
bulkheads, but ensure access and condensation issues are resolved

Coordinate building and external streetscape / public realm levels and details
early

Use a Lead Consultant for all landscaping / infrastructure / public realm areas to
ensure full coordination

Incorporate sufficiently large tolerances from the frame onwards, with a design
tolerance matrix to identify issues if design changes affect them — ensure all
zones take account of the full build-up of the related building and installation
tolerances

Increase tolerances to give flexibility to meet the numerous critical design
constraint dimensions imposed by LTH, HQIs, WCH etc (increased GEA justified
by increased buildability)

Design structure to enable flexibility to precast and stitch together on site

Involve subcontractors early to steer design based on preferred
construction methods (and adjust design release programme)

Site-wide design guides to be in place at briefing stage, and all requirements
fully detailed and communicated to the whole team (including for SVP access
and maintenance access that have different solutions on different buildings -
see note under Commissioning & Testing also)

Apex cabling — bigger cable than originally, value for money with reduced labour
on site but increased design labour as less flexible — clear advantage?

Incorporate concrete upstands to parapets as they are fully protected and easier
to weatherproof early than alternatives

Use of precast cladding de-risked site operations but created a risk of
subcontractor failure — single storey would have shortened programme as
double storey panels had to be double-handled

Use basic chassis (courtyard) design as it provides control of design
development given the time constraints on master planning and tenure
modelling

additional provision

= Arrange floor layouts to make SVPs in-line vertically and enable fire collars and
insulation to be installed, and ensure rodding points are accessible (consider
locating hatches in corridors where possible)

Quality Process Lend Lease
Quality Process ——_—

Lend Lease

Engage project team, subcontractors and external stakeholders early in
the process, including attendance at quality workshops — early
identification of issues with NHBC and Triathlon worked well

Deliver benchmarks (including accelerated apartments) early, and get
input from all parties (including NHBC & JLAB) — use off-site as well as on-
site where possible (e.g. balconies) ~ allow for out-of-sequence working and
additional resources required

Carry out quality inductions to drive key messages and demonstrate
expectations early - would have assisted progressing benchmarks earlier

Implement a simple effective samples and benchmarks process, and use
an electronic system for sign-offs

QA tracker with identified stages was a successful tool and should be
developed to include commissioning — commercial team could use it more
to control payments — don’t let focus on Milestone 5 detrimentally affect
the rest of the project - focus on Milestone 9 as this is the key hold point

Lend Lease

Put M&E testing and fire stopping in Hold Point QA3 of QA tracker instead of
QA4

Use site-wide standards for benchmarks and samples to give consistency,
and make signed-off physical benchmarks and samples of an agreed fixed
list accessible for reference

Arrange for sufficient personnel (e.g. from ODA and JLAB) to deal with
numerous handovers very close together, and from JLAB at earlier stages
in construction to reduce pressure at final inspections

Apply second coat of paint initially to meet ODA expectations, with a third ‘touch-
up’ coat post games

Issue robust quality procedures, including requirements for samples and
benchmarks, at tender stage to ensure requirements fully allowed for, and
ensure subcontractors are able to maintain the required quality on
possible large numbers over multiple buildings

Use pods as they were finished to a good quality generally and benefitted the
