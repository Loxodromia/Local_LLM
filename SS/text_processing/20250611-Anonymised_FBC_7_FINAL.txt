PROGRAMME  NAME FULL  BUSINESS CASE   
Investing in PROGRAMME  strategic capability is essential to maintain relevance 
and UK political choice as detailed in the Defence Command Plan ( DATE ). Without 
an upgraded capability, REDACTED . This Business Case brings together two 
inextricably linked and interdependent projects – each with funding provision – 
into a single approval: REDACTED.    
REDACTED  is vital to REDACTED . REDACTED  investment sustains a highly 
specialised, world -leading UK industry base and ensures advanced technical skills 
and expertise are available for the ( PROGRAMME NAME ) programme. Delivering 
REDACTED  into service demonstrates REDACTED . Integrating  REDACTED  onto  
PROGRAMME  ensures that it remains competitive for winning new export orders 
and provides a lucrative revenue stream for UK industry from retrofitting the 
DELIVERABLE  onto current PROGRAMME  REDACTED .   
Issue  
1. Demonstration and Manufacture (D&M) phase of the PROGRAMME  
DELIVERABLE , including REDACTED , to deliver Full Operating Capability (FOC).  
Timing  
2. Approval is required by DATE  to continue  REDACTED . 
 
Subject to approval, initial contract activity in DATE  will commit £ XXXX .   
Recommendations  
3. The Approving Authority is invited to approve:   
a. Commitment to deliver the D&M scope for DELIVERABLE , inclusive of 
REDACTED .  
  
b. An Approved Budgetary Level (ABL) of £XXXX at 50% confidence to complete 
the delivery of the D&M phase and achieve FOC, taking the total ABL for the 
overall REDACTED  and DELIVERABLE  programme from £ XXXX  to £XXXX  
(outturn, inclusive of all non -recoverable VAT). This contains XXXX  calculated 
using the DEM exchange rates and associated exchange rate uncertainty and 
comprises:  
  
(1) £XXXX  capital expenditure (CDEL).  
(2) £XXXX  total resource consumption (RDEL).  
       
  
  
  
  c. A separate provision of £ XXXX  as Risk Outside Costing based on the delta 
between the 70%CL and 50%CL (aggregate method) of the DEM exchange 
rate uncertainty.  
d. Schedule for delivery of DELIVERABLE  as:  
(1) Initial Operating Capability (IOC) by DATE  (50% Confidence).  
(2) FOC by DATE  (50% Confidence).  
e. IOC and FOC definitions at Annex B.  
f. Key User Requirements (KURs) at Annex C.  
4. And to note :  
a. To date, UK investment in DELIVERABLE  has matured the technology and 
reduced technical risk on the programme. REDACTED . In DATE , subject to 
approval, a X-year commitment to continue  REDACTED  development will be 
made, including trials with the prototype DELIVERABLE  in DATE , hardware 
and software development to deliver a production  DELIVERABLE  system 
ready for integration.   
b. Concurrent with  REDACTED  development, a REDACTED  will commence in 
DATE  through a System Definition (SD) contract.  
 
The SD phase will establish the design solution for a common system 
interface REDACTED . SD will provide the detailed requirements needed by 
REDACTED to enable a proposal to be delivered in DATE  for integrating the  
REDACTED  DELIVERABLE  onto PROGRAMME  through a DELIVERABLE  
Demonstration Contract. DELIVERABLE  is not limited to REDACTED , but 
includes a broader range of capability upgrades that are required in the same 
timeframe as the DELIVERABLE . For the UK the Minimum Viable Programme 
(MVP) for DELIVERABLE  includes REDACTED . The MVP also includes the 
introduction of REDACTED . Together this package of upgrades is sufficient to 
meet the KURs. Whilst the DELIVERABLE  package and REDACTED  will be 
embodied across the UK REDACTED, REDACTED  DELIVERABLE  will only 
be embodied on REDACTED .  
  
c. The final content of the DELIVERABLE  package is subject to negotiations with 
PNs and is dependent on agreeing a level of cost share and priority of each 
nation’s requested candidates; therefore the final content is likely to be greater 
than that required for the UK MVP (a list of UK addition al candidates not 
included in the MVP is attached at Annex D). Securing a 100% UK -funded 
position for the MVP package is central to the UK’s negotiation strategy to 
protect the REDACTED  delivery timeline by removing reli ance on PN funding 
and ensuring that essential  REDACTED  enabling content is included and 
protected within the broader DELIVERABLE  package. Moreover, it is in the 
UK’s national interest to maintain strategic con trol of DELIVERABLE  in the      
  
  
  context of the competing PROGRAMME  DELIVERABLE  programmes, 
specifically with COUNTRY , in a challenging multinational environment.   
  
d. Supply for REDACTED  (REDACTED ) remains a strategic risk for the 
programme, with only one supplier capable of providing this essential product 
for REDACTED . Continued sustainment funding is essential to secure a long -
term commitment with the supplier to the end of DATE , therefore an additional 
c£XXXX  has been included in this FBC.  
e. DELIVERABLE  also demands changes to the PROGRAMME  Future Synthetic 
Training ( PFST ), REDACTED  and deployable infrastructure to deliver IOC. 
Scoping assessments have been conducted with costs included within the 
ABL (Annex E).   
  
f. The FBC approval covers the totality of activity to deliver DELIVERABLE , 
including delivery and integration of REDACTED . Subject to approval, 
c£XXXX will be committed in DATE  to ensure seamless continuation of 
REDACTED  development (critical path activity to IOC), secure REDACTED  
(REDACTED ) supply from a UK List X company and strengthen UK 
international control of the DELIVERABLE  strategy. Thereafter, the next major 
commitment is late DATE  for the DELIVERABLE  Demonstration Contract with 
an expected value to the UK of £XXXX . Ahead of that commitment a 
Review Note (RN) will be submitted to confirm the agreed composition of 
non-DELIVERABLE  capabilities within the DELIVERABLE  package post 
negotiations with PNs and re -affirm deliverability within the overall ABL . 
Thereafter, c £XXXX  is committed in DATE  REDACTED  manufacturing and 
assembly; c £XXXX  in DATE  for embodiment and development of the 
REDACTED  to achieve the FOC standard. Information Notes will also be 
provided ahead of each of these major commitments. The li st above excludes 
smaller discrete cross DLOD investments planned between DATES  and which 
makes up the total ABL of £ XXXX.   
  
g. PROGRAMME NAME . Maximum re -use of REDACTED  technology has been 
assumed by the SRO and  DELIVERABLE  Design Authority ( COMPANY ) 
wherever appropriate in the design of the System for the PROGRAMME 
NAME  programme. The programmatic impact of cancelling REDACTED  on 
PROGRAMME NAME  has been assessed as X years delay and at least an 
additional £ XXXX  of direct costs from the technology transfer. However, this 
excludes the wider cost benefit to PROGRAMME NAME  derived from an 
REDACTED  programme that develops and maintains the industrial and MOD 
SQEP, manufacturi ng, trials and evaluation, mission data capability and 
operational experience gained from delivering a new DELIVERABLE  into 
service. The cost benefit for PROGRAMME NAME  and therefore cost risk 
should REDACTED  be cancelled, is estimated as c £XXXX .   
  
h. Delays in the current REDACTED  project have impacted the forecast IOC by 
DATE  since the last REDACTED  approval in DATE , primarily driven by late 
approva l and supplier performance.       
  
  
  
  i. DELIVERABLE  (also known as DELIVERABLE ), underwent a contract 
amendment in DATE  to prioritise REDACTED  for PROGRAMME  export1 and 
which also removed REDACTED scope which will now be delivered as part of 
DELIVERABLE . DELIVERABLE  dependencies have been reflected in the 
DELIVERABLE  schedule and cost included in the overall ABL.  
  
j. In-Service costs (including spiral) for DELIVERABLE  to a DATE  Out of Service 
(OSD) are estimated as £ XXXX  (50% Confidence); these costs are excluded 
from the ABL but noted for completeness.  
  
k. A potential cost variation of £ XXXX  due to exchange rate volatility between the 
DEM rate and the CPA rate. This is to be managed centrally by DefRes for 
centrally approved cases.  
  
  
Strategic Case  
 REDACTED   
5. The military capability requirement for a replacement DELIVERABLE  for 
PROGRAMME  has been well -documented through successive defence reviews.  
REDACTED  will sustain operational advantage for the UK military within the anticipated 
threat/operating environment until PROGRAMME ’s OSD and will:  
a. Recover shortfalls in existing capability, sustaining REDACTED ;  
  
b. Enable REDACTED ;  
  
c. REDACTED .  
  
6. The DELIVERABLE  offers a capability that will address three critical and linked 
strategic justifications  for the UK.  
a. REDACTED .  REDACTED  and an open architecture that allows rapid, low 
cost adaptation.  
  
b. UK Prosperity . Substantial economic benefit and prosperity to the UK from 
sustaining PROGRAMME’s  credibility and demonstrating viability in export 
campaigns; the opportunity for retro -fit to the large, established 
PROGRAMME s in-service with core and export nations and indirectly through 
independent sustainment of UK, high -end facilities, knowledge and workforce 
during the transition from  PROGRAMME  to PROGRAMME NAME . 
DELIVERABLE  is vital for the maintenance of UK industrial advantage and 
suitably qualified and experienced personnel within the SECTOR , especially 
 
      
  
  
  relative to COUNTRY  during the positioning and industrial consolidation 
associated with the various PROGRAMME NAME  programmes .   
  
(1)  Export Opportunity . Once DELIVERABLE  is formalised as a 
baseline product, existing  PROGRAMME  export customers can only maintain 
a capability development path by buying into the product; export customers 
will be compelled to join DELIVERABLE  in order to secure non -discretionary 
R&M capabilities. The recent COUNTRY    precedent demonstrates the 
potential of export participation to help reduce core nations costs with early 
contractual and commercial engagement. With no engagement the worst -case 
scenario w ould be an Industry to export nation sale of a delivered product with 
the benefit limited to a proportion of the 10% CEL. This means a realistic 
financial benefit of £ XXXX  to £XXXX in later years from existing export 
customers depending on participation and securing CEL.  
  
c.   (PROGRAMME NAME ). DELIVERABLE  will de -risk technical development 
and skills for the next generation of UK combat REDACTED   
(PROGRAMME NAME / PROGRAMME NAME ). The REDACTED  will be a key 
component of the PROGRAMME NAME  solution, with the ability to deliver 
REDACTED  underpinning the UK’s credibility in playing a leading/major role in an 
international PROGRAMME NAME  programme. Key linkages include the following:  
  
(1) PROGRAMME NAME  is critically dependent on REDACTED  to develop 
SQEP and mature capability across a range of development, manufacturing 
and test & evaluation areas that will only be tested by the introduction of an 
operational system. Allowing the associated industrial and military skills to 
atrophy will le ad to a significant schedule impact to PROGRAMME NAME , 
with the potential for loss of capability that cannot be easily resurrected. 
Evidence suggests a delay in PROGRAMME NAME  FOC capability of 
between  X and X years if REDACTED  is not delivered into servic e on  
PROGRAMME  and flown in an operational representative environment.  
  
(2) PROGRAMME NAME  is critically dependent on REDACTED that are being 
developed for  REDACTED . The direct additional cost pressure to 
PROGRAMME NAME  of developing these elements in the absence of 
REDACTED  is at least c.£ XXXX  and excludes costs caused by a delay to the 
PROGRAMME NAME  programme.   
  
(3) Although the direct hardware dependencies between REDACTED  and 
REDACTED  are limited beyond assets already developed , PROGRAMME 
NAME  benefits from reductions in cost due to the use of similar components to 
REDACTED .  
  
(4)  REDACTED  is fundamental, with no viable alternative, for the sustainment 
and maintenance of a supply chain (beyond the major stakeholders of 
COMPANY , COMPANY  and COMPANY ) to be available and viable to support 
the creation of an PROGRAMME NAME  product in the latter half of the 
decade.       
  
  
  
    
(5) No alternative approaches to sustain REDACTED , supplier base and 
develop capability mitigate the likely performance, cost and schedule impacts 
on a UK developed PROGRAMME NAME  if REDACTED  is not delivered into 
service.  
  
7. Additionally, there is a cost benefit to PROGRAMME NAME  from the REDACTED  
programme from maintaining the industrial and MOD SQEP as well as the 
manufacturing, trials and evaluation, mission data capability and operational experience 
from successfully integrating a new  DELIVERABLE . One option considered later in this 
business case is delivering an IOC capability but then using that capability for the benefit 
of PROGRAMME NAME  only. The cost of that option is estimated at c.£ XXXX  and 
therefore represents a p otential additional cost pressure to PROGRAMME NAME  should 
REDACTED  be cancelled.     
8. Classified briefings are available to provide UK senior leadership a full 
understanding of the innovative nature of this UK technical solution, its vital contribution 
to UK Defence’s capability requirement and its strategic relevance and benefit to the UK.   
DELIVERABLE   
9. As part of the REDACTED  programme, the route to deliver significant 
PROGRAMME  capability enhancements is through extensive and protracted 
engagement, negotiation, and compromise. This is particularly relevant for the delivery of 
DELIVERABLE  which will be the primary delivery vehicle for integrating  REDACTED .   
REDACTED  cannot be embodied on PROGRAMME  outside a REDACTED  as this 
provides the necessary changes to the system software and ensures the continued 
participation of all Partner Companies.  
10. DELIVERABLE  sits as a core block within the X+ year PROGRAMME  
development planning horizon that has been agreed by REDACTED .  The plan includes 
the contractually committed (in DATE ) REDACTED  as the baseline product for 
DELIVERABLE  development and shows the REDACTED  programme following 
DELIVERABLE  later this decade.  
11. In addition to  REDACTED , the UK scope for DELIVERABLE  includes other time 
critical upgrades for the PROGRAMME  REDACTED , as below.  Together, this package 
constitutes the MVP for the UK and is sufficient to meet the KURs.  
a. REDACTED  
 
International Dynamic and Negotiations   
12. Due to the critical nature of the DELIVERABLE  content to the UK for the success 
of REDACTED , the intent from this FBC is to secure a 100% UK -funded position. This is 
considered the most cost -effective negotiation strategy and increases the UK authority 
and influence in managing the DELIVERABLE  programme. The major concern and risk      
  
  
  is considered to be that despite apparent alignment in DATE , there remain divergent 
priorities and ambitions for DELIVERABLE , particularly with regards to delivery 
timeframes.  This has primarily been driven by the COUNTRY  DELIVERABLE  
programme, which may not deliver a full capability until at least DATE .  This is being 
managed as part of the UK negotiation strategy, with the UK priority to deliver 
DELIVERABLE  on a baseline as soon as practical . 
13. Negotiations to agree the product strategy for DELIVERABLE  are ongoing. This 
case does not pre -empt the final negotiated outcome, nor assume the international 
funding contributions and agreed down -selection of DELIVERABLE  additional capability 
candidates. As such, the scope of this approval assumes a 100% UK -funded position to 
deliver a minimum viable baseline, meeting regulatory and mandatory requirements, 
across all  DELIVERABLE  variants embodied on the UK REDACTED  and  REDACTED  
embodied on all REDACTED . This will additionally maintain a common baseline across 
the UK REDACTED . The risk in not securing a 100% UK -funded budget is that we will 
have a funding reliance on PNs, for whom the time imperative is less relevant, to proceed 
through the contracting points,   
14. As part of the negotiation with the PNs, the UK will make choices about balancing 
increasing DELIVERABLE  scope with DELIVERABLE  funding contributions from the 
PNs. These negotiations are unlikely to conclude until REDACTED can provide a fixed 
price DELIVERABLE  Contract in DATE  to deliver an IOC capability. Prioritisation of 
potential capability upgrades over and above the UK MVP is at Annex D.  
       
  
  
  
  Economic Case  
Benchmarking  REDACTED   
15. Two benchmarks for REDACTED  are:  REDACTED  vs other PROGRAMME   
DELIVERABLE  variants;  REDACTED  vs similar DELIVERABLE  capabilities delivered on 
other REDACTED .   
16. UK MOD has a detailed understanding of the capability, specification, and design 
of the alternative PROGRAMME  variants due to the UK’s extensive test programme. The 
DELIVERABLE  is obsolete, does not currently meet the KURs and is architecturally 
incapable of doing so. DELIVERABLE  and DELIVERABLE  have a comparable 
development and unit cost to REDACTED  but with significantly less capability and, 
having inherited architecture and “back -end”, are incapable of meeting the KURs given 
the hardware and architecture .  
17. Whilst integrating a DELIVERABLE  from one REDACTED  type to another is not 
technically sensible or cost effective, those DELIVERABLEs  do provide ideal 
programmatic benchmarks for cost and performance. REDACTED.   
Industrial   
18. The UK’s share of the DELIVERABLE  and REDACTED market has reduced, such 
that only COMPANY  and C OMPANY  remain internationally competitive for 
DELIVERABLE  and DELIVERABLE  respectively. The volume of work without 
REDACTED  is insufficient to sustain a viable national enterprise as well as UK SMEs 
across academia, Research and Development, MOD, ORGANISATION  and 
organisations such as COMPANY .   
19. Discontinuing REDACTED  development would have several immediate and 
longer term  impacts on PROGRAMME NAME  and represents a risk to the UK’s strategic 
military and industrial position. Cancellation means the short -term ceding of influence 
and revenue to other nations such as COUNTR IES and in the longer term represents a 
threat to the credibility and viability of PROGRAMME NAME .    
  
  
  
 Export    
20.  REDACTED  is seen as a minimum acceptable capability standard for export 
opportunities.  REDACTED , as part of an international DELIVERABLE  baseline, forms a 
key component of a credible and capable UK PROGRAMME  export to COUNTR IES. The 
UK will benefit from export sales of PROGRAMME  through continuation of production 
facilities and design work in COMPANY  and suppliers, improved productivity, economies 
of scale in capability development and support, Commercial Exploitation Levy and 
reduction in our costs to ma nage the end of manufacturing and assembly.  
21. Proceeding with DELIVERABLE  and REDACTED  also opens up opportunities for 
retrofitting the upgrades on PROGRAMME  REDACTED  currently in service with 
COUNTRY and COUNTRY  and achieving a common  baseline across all DELIVERABLE  
configurations ( DELIVERABLE , DELIVERABLE ).  
Options   
22. Due to the AGREEMENT  for PROGRAMME  capability delivery  there are no viable 
industrial or commercial routes to deliver the upgrades outside of the current COMPANY 
consortium. This enforces a common baseline and integration / clearance across all 
subsystems. The following options have been considered for this case:  
a. Option 1 - Do Nothing.  REDACTED . This option is not recommended.   
  
b. Option 2 – Do Minimum.  Proceed with a Minimum Viable Programme 
(MVP) for DELIVERABLE .  REDACTED.  This option is recommended.   
  
c. Option 3 – Do Maximum.  Proceed with the full package of UK 
capability upgrades in DELIVERABLE . As per Option 2 but this option would 
deliver the full scope of the potential capability upgrades for DELIVERABLE  listed 
at Annex D. The deterministic cost from Industry, excluding cost uncertainty and 
risk, was estimated at c.£ XXXX . This option has not been taken forward for a 
detailed cost benefit analysis as it would be an unaffordable position for the UK. 
This option is not recommended.   
  
d. Option 4a – Do Different.  Complete REDACTED  development but do 
not complete integration onto PROGRAMME . REDACTED . This option is not 
recommended.   
  
e. Option 4b – Do Different. REDACTED . This option is not 
recommended.   
  
Recommended Option   
23. Option 2 is recommended as it delivers the minimum scope to meet the KURs and 
achieves the strategic benefits of the DELIVERABLE  and REDACTED  programme. 
Subject to approval, next steps include:       
  
  
 a. In DATE , an immediate c£ XXXX  commitment to REDACTED  hardware and 
software development, REDACTED  sustainment and DELIVERABLE  
CONTRACT .   
b. In late DATE , a c£ XXXX  commitment to the DELIVERABLE  Contract.   
c. In DATE , a c£ XXXX  commitment to REDACTED  manufacturing and assembly.   
d. In DATE , a £XXXX  commitment to REDACTED  embodiment and development 
of the REDACTED  to achieve the FOC standard.   
24. Information Notes will be provided ahead of each commitment. For the 
DELIVERABLE  Demonstration Phase Contract in late DATE , an RN will confirm the 
agreed composition of non -DELIVERABLE  capabilities in the final agreed 
DELIVERABLE  package post negotiations with other PNs, and re -affirm 
deliverability within the overall ABL. The list above excludes smaller discrete cross 
DLOD investments planned between DATES .   
Commercial Case  
25. Contract activities will be principally delivered through AGREEMENT  within the 
extant commercial framework2. In DATE , two initial parallel commitments are 
required: REDACTED  hardware/software development and DELIVERABLE  
development. The financial commitment to deliver these work packages is £ XXXX .   
 
a.  REDACTED  hardware/software development.  A further development 
contract for REDACTED  hardware / software development is required to ensure 
continuity and maintain the critical path as the current work packages conclude in 
DATE . The contract length will be c. Xyrs, delivering the production standard  
REDACTED   DELIVERABLE  in readiness for integration, test, and trials. Scope 
includes trials of the REDACTED  prototype in DATE  and completion of software 
development by DATE  to help generate an IOC capability, bef ore integration with 
the system through the DELIVERABLE  Contract. The proposal will be negotiated 
directly between UK MoD and COMPANY  / COMPANY  UK, seeking to maximise 
the benefit of long -term subsupplier contracts. This contract will include a long -term 
commitment to production investment and REDACTED  sustainment with 
COMPANY  to secure supply for the UK REDACTED  demand.  
b. DELIVERABLE  Systems Development.  A CONTRACT  to deliver the 
remaining assessment activities for DELIVERABLE  development. It includes early 
demonstration phase activities to maintain the critical path to IOC and provides the 
detailed systems requirements for Industry to generate proposals for the 
DELIVERABLE  Demonstration Phase contract.  
 
 
     
  
  
 26. A DELIVERABLE  Demonstration Contract will then be contracted following the 
completion of the DELIVERABLE  package outlined above. This contract will cover 
the test, trials, and evaluation activity to integrate REDACTED  and other 
DELIVERABLE  capability upgrades onto PROGRAMME  to meet the IOC 
requirements. The total UK commitment to the DELIVERABLE  Demonstration 
Phase contract is expected to be c£ XXXX . Ahead of commitment to the 
DELIVERABLE  Demonstration Contract in late DATE , a Review Note will be 
submitted t o confirm the final agreed composition of non -DELIVERABLE  
capabilities to be adopted in DELIVERABLE  and re -affirm deliverability within the 
ABL without erosion of the programme management reserve.   
27. The remaining development and manufacture to meet the FOC requirements and 
embodiment across the full UK PROGRAMME  will be contracted via the 
AGREEMENT  CONTRACT  frameworks as appropriate with commitments expected 
between DATES .   
28. The terms and conditions of AGREEMENT  Contracts allow for National Price 
Investigation (NPI), whereby the MODs of UK  and COUNTR IES will investigate the 
prices quoted . 
Financial Case  
29. The total cost estimates for this FBC combine the investment required to deliver 
REDACTED  (£XXXX  plus £ XXXX  for REDACTED ) and costs associated with 
DELIVERABLE  which integrates the DELIVERABLE  onto PROGRAMME , enables  
REDACTED  KURs, and delivers a range of time critical capability upgrades and 
REDACTED  DLOD investment to gain maximum benefit from the capability 
upgrade .  The cost estimates have been developed collaboratively with UK industry 
over several years, sourced from a mix of historic fixed pricing, near neighbour and 
supplier estimates. The combination of cost uncertainty and risk has resulted in a 
management reser ve of c.£ XXXX  within the ABL, the difference between the 
Deterministic estimate and 50% modelled outcome. Al though PN funding is not 
assumed in helping the UK deliver the MVP for DELIVERABLE , the potential net 
cost saving arising from PN financial contribution to DELIVERABLE  has been 
modelled as an opportunity.   
30. The following table provides a cost breakdown (10/50/90% confidence), based on 
Option 2, for this approval (D&M phase).   
Project Phase   Confidence Levels (£M)  
10%  50%  90%  
Historic Sunk  XXXX  XXXX  XXXX  
Demonstration  XXXX  XXXX  XXXX  
Production Investment  XXXX  XXXX  XXXX  
Manufacture, Assembly and Embodiment  XXXX  XXXX  XXXX      
  
  
 DLODs, PSS & Synthetic Upgrades  XXXX  XXXX  XXXX  
Total for D&M Phase  XXXX  XXXX  XXXX  
Total ABL  XXXX  XXXX  XXXX  
  
31. Until the industry proposals are received, a definitive position regarding Contingent 
Liability cannot be confirmed, however, based on previous tasks of this nature it is 
anticipated that a Contingent Liability will not be required.   
32. The Integrated Review settlement for REDACTED  provided funding of £ XXXX  for  
 REDACTED . Additionally, the  PROGRAMME  Base Level Budget (BLB) includes 
provision for DELIVERABLE  and other capability upgrades. The overall affordability 
position against the combination of the  REDACTED  and DELIVERABLE  funding is 
provided at Annex G. The forecast cost (at 50% confidence) to deliver the 
DELIVERABLE  MVP is affordable in total but with unaffordability profile challenges in yrs 
1-3 of £ XXX. However, when the funding provision is compared against a schedule risk 
adjusted profile of costs, i.e. a 50% profile that reflects the delays expected in the 50% 
confidence schedule, that affordability challenge is reduced to £ XXX in yr 2.      
Management Case  
Programme Management   
33. There have been delays to the REDACTED  and DELIVERABLE  contracts (early 
notification to approving authority in the DELIVERABLE  / DELIVERABLE  Information 
Note), driven by later than planned approval of RN causing a linear X month delay  and 
supplier performance due to technical complexity. The performance of the suppliers has 
stabilised, and previous delays reflected in the schedule to achieve IOC/FOC.  
34. Since DATE  a Joint Project Office between MOD, COMPANY  and COMPANY  UK 
has been established at COMPANY  to improve Management Information and provide 
greater MOD governance during the supplier decision making process. This has 
improved transparency of technical issues across the three organisations and led to early 
intervention. Lessons have also been learn t and applied from the DELIVERABLE  
programme, including the adoption of sufficient trial and software fix cycles within the 
planning for DELIVERABLE .  
35. The programme (Annex F) can be broadly characterised as two dependent 
development streams, the REDACTED  DELIVERABLE  and DELIVERABLE  REDACTED      
system upgrade. The REDACTED  development will include prototype trials in DATE , and 
a declaration of design performance for the production standard REDACTED  in early 
DATE . This development is concurrent to the DELIVERABLE  REDACTED  system 
development that will incorporate the interface and interoperability changes as well as 
delivering a complementary package of upgrades that form the UK MVP.  
36. A detailed schedule to IOC for REDACTED  has been maintained since DATE  and 
further developed to incorporate the system development schedule. DELIVERY 
ORGANISATION  and UK Industry have assessed the programme logic and 
dependencies, including areas of uncertainty and risk (Annex F). The 10/50/90%     
  
  
 confidence levels for IOC/FOC are detailed below. With a schedule deterministic date of 
DATE  for IOC, the 50% modelled outcome includes X months of risk and uncertainty.   
  Confidence Levels   
10%  50%  90%  
IOC  DATE  DATE  DATE  
FOC  DATE  DATE  DATE  
  
Risk Management   
37. Continuity of REDACTED  (REDACTED ) supply through COMPANY , a UK List X 
supplier in  LOCATION , remains an existential threat to REDACTED  and a strategic 
industrial risk to Defence. The assumption in the RN that FMC would manage 
continued sustainment of COMPANY  from DATE  has not materialised. As such, the 
sustainment costs have been captured within this FBC. COMPANY  UK has 
engaged COMPANY  to establish the conditions for a long -term business agreement 
to reduce the risk exposure. COMPANY  has indicated that a con tractual 
commitment for REDACTED  for REDACTED  development and production 
manufacturing would “guarantee” sufficient assets to meet the UK requirement for 
FOC.   
38. The performance and time parameters within this FBC represent the minimum 
capability that would be achieved when fully funded by the UK. Despite this funding 
position, agreement to proceed would be required by the PNs. Participation by the 
COMPANY , most notably COMPANY  due to changes in REDACTED , is integral to 
the     system development.  
39. The programme risks are detailed at Annex H.  
Governance   
40. Overall PROGRAMME  programme execution is managed by AGREEMENT . The 
UK, supplemented by the introduction of the REDACTED  JPO, has direct programme 
management and oversight of REDACTED  development, within the boundaries of the 
AGREEMENT  contractual framework. The system development, through the 
DELIVERABLE  and DELIVERABLE  Demonstration Contracts, will remain primarily 
governed by AGREEMENT , with the UK and PNs as Customers.  
41.  REDACTED  has joined the REDACTED in DATE  and as such is in the process of 
establishing the specific governance arrangements expected to manage the programme.  
42. Subject to approval of this FBC, no further FBC submissions are planned to 
complete the D&M phase and achieve FOC. However, a separate approval will follow in 
DATE  for the additional in -service support costs required to sustain the upgraded 
PROGRAMME  capability in service to the current OSD of DATE . An RN will also be 
submitted in late  DATE , ahead of commitment to the DELIVERABLE  Demonstration 
Contract, and further Information Notes provided on request.  
Presentation and Handling      
  
  
 43.  REDACTED  will be reported as part of the REDACTED following the UK 
Government commitment to the project, referenced through the Integrated Review DATE . 
Failure to deliver REDACTED  will impact UK credibility to deliver the PROGRAMME 
NAME  programme.   
44. Along with the DELIVERABLE  DELIVERABLE  capabilities, this programme will 
provide a step change in UK capability, addressing regulatory and mandatory 
requirements and providing significant investment for Defence Industry. The continuation 
of DELIVERABLE  development within the UK ensures REDACTED  and limits the 
reliance upon international partners, most notably de -risking the transition to 
PROGRAMME NAME .   
45. DELIVERABLE  would increase the likelihood of success of PROGRAMME  in 
ongoing and prospective export campaigns in COUNTR IES as well as reinforce the 
MOD’s relationships with REDACTED  and UK Industry. Further investment in COMPANY  
UK demonstrates political intent to “level up” the UK.  
46. Presentational challenges are anticipated if Option 2 is approved, due to the 
significant investment and slip against delivery forecasts (cost and schedule bridging at 
Annex I). REDACTED.  However, if Option 1 was approved this would cause MoD 
reputational damage, with an estimated Constructive Loss of £ XXXX . Lines to take will 
be generated in line with IAC decision and direction.

DLOD Summary  
  
1.   REDACTED  DLOD costs were assessed previously as part of the RN in DATE . 
Since   approval further work has been conducted to mature DLOD scope and cost, and 
to expand to encompass non -DELIVERABLE  elements of DELIVERABLE . DLOD maturity 
is assessed by DELIVERY ORGANISATION  as being as expected for the stage of the 
programme.  
a. Training . A REDACTED  Training Needs Analysis (TNA) was completed by 
COMPANY  in DATE  covering maintenance, support, and pilot needs, but 
excluding synthetics. A fully developed synthetic training capability is 
essential due to limitations in the use of REDACTED . Workshops between 
MoD and Industry have scoped requirements of the DELIVERABLE  
synthetic solution based around the fidelity and capabilities of the 
REDACTED  model that needs to be developed for  PROGRAMME . 
REDACTED. Indicative costs have been provided by industry based on 
scaled near neighbour comparators for DELIVERABLE  and non - 
DELIVERABLE  DELIVERABLE  elements and included in the ABL. There is 
a dependency on OTHER PROGRAMME  to provide REDACTED .  
b. Equipment .  DELIVERABLE s and support equipment will be delivered as 
part of the Demonstration Contract. In addition, a Hardware in the Loop 
(HIL) facility is required at LOCATION  to allow independent service testing, 
including assurance of Mission Data (MD) and REDACTED  software. 
Completion of the mission support element has been delayed; in lieu the 
ORGANISATION  (ORGANISATION ) have assessed HIL capabilities. 
ORGANISATION  requirements have been tailored accordingly. Industry 
have provided cost estimates for  the HIL equipment.   
c. Personnel . Additional MoD and contractor personnel will be required to 
support DELIVERABLE  test and evaluation through the Demonstration 
Contract, with a continuing requirement once spiral development 
commences following IOC. REDACTED.   
d. Information . Several work -strands have been identified under the 
information DLOD. REDACTED.    
e. Doctrine . A REDACTED  ITEAP was issued in DATE  as an Annex to the 
main  PROGRAMME  ITEAP and has been reviewed by REDACTED . A 
DELIVERABLE  In-Service Concept of Assurance defining the level of 
capability expected from the ORGANISATION to assure different 
REDACTED  capabilities is in draft and under REDACTED  review. Existing 
REDACTED  resource will be used to support doctrine DLOD development 
to FOC, and no significant new costs are envisaged.  
f. Organisation . No significant costs are envisaged.      
 g. Infrastructure . Significant new REDACTED  and deployable infrastructure 
will be required. REDACTED.   
h. Logistics . Industry have provided an assessment of the costs associated 
with DELIVERABLE  / DELIVERABLE  introduction into service and annual 
support costs. Work is ongoing to determine REDACTED.    
i. Security . The main effort of the Security DLOD has been to support 
development of an accreditable equipment design, and to secure alignment 
of UK security and classification needs with the expectations of 
AGREEMENT  partners nations and Industry. DELIVERY ORGANISATION  
Security SMEs have also supported development of the security aspects of 
the Infra and Info DLODs.  
j. Spiral . Spiral costs are outside of this FBC approval but noted for 
completeness. Spiral development is essential to field the full 
DELIVERABLE  capability set, and to maintain capability as the threat 
environment changes, as well as maintaining national DELIVERABLE  
SQEP. Understanding of the candidate capabilities for the early years of 
spiral has matured but spiral resource assumptions and cost estimates per 
year have remained unchange d.  REDACTED.  
.   
k. Government Furnished Assets (GFX) . A joint MoD / Industry assessment 
of GFX has been conducted to list all expected demands for the 
programme. These are predominantly common assets that have been used 
in previous AGREEMENT  contracts and have been provisioned within 
scope and ABL e.g. development REDACTED . Additional costed risks are 
included in the Management Reserve to address emergent GFX demands. 
Key items include REDACTED .

Risks  
  
ID  Risk Description  Mitigation  Post -Mitigation  
Prob  T  C  P  
 
  Due to limited commercial profitability for REDACTED  from the 
COMPANY  foundry, there is a risk that the REDACTED  supplier 
(COMPANY ) may choose to leave the market and no longer support 
the DELIVERABLE  programme.  
Resulting in delays to schedule and cost to establish capabilities of 
an alternative FACILITY  (none of which presently exist) & time  
to establish relationship.  REDACTED    H  H    
 Due to individual National interests that include generating 
intellectual property for PROGRAMME NAME , industrial strategy and 
capability, there is a risk of continued misalignment in programme 
priority between Nations.  
Resulting in delayed decision making and/ or change in programme 
direction  REDACTED     VH      
 Due to early PDR/CDRs and the significant time between System 
CDR and IOC (during which the MOD has liability for obsolescence), 
there is a risk of obsolescence post -CDR for REDACTED . Resulting 
in a need for Last Time Buy or Fit Form and Function replacement 
(redesign considered high cost/ schedule impact but much lower 
likelihood).  REDACTED       VH        
  
ID  Risk Description  Mitigation  Post -Mitigation  
Prob  T  C  P  
  Because of an inability to agree underpinning program principles , late 
proposal from Industry and timely nations approval, there is a risk 
that proposal expires/ price negotiation takes longer  
Resulting in funding continuity between DELIVERABLE  and     
CONTRACT  contracts not maintained with non -linear schedule 
delays.  Continuous engagement 
with 
COMPANY /AGREEMENT  
to support  
scoping and timely 
contracting.    M  L
