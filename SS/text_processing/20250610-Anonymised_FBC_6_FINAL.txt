Strategic Case  
 
5. Background.  REDACTED  are continuing to evolve in order to REDACTED . 
REDACTED  has specialist capabilities that provide and support the delivery of these 
strategic and operational effects. REDACTED contributes to these outputs by delivering 
 
1 This FBC does not seek approval for demonstration costs.    niche effects, enabling delivery of DELIVERABLES.  The capability provided support s 
NSO s X and X and Defence Tasks.  
 
6. Justification.  Operational Analysis has identified  the extant requirement fo r 
REDACTED.  Project  PROJECT NAME  will address the se capability shortfalls , which have 
been identified and captured within the SUR  and which  have shaped the Project ’s 
demanding set of requirements.  
7. Requirement.  REDACTED . 
 
8. Candidate KURs.  The candidate  KURs are  at Annex A; the SRD is at Enclosure 2.  
 
a. The Delivery Team (DT) have determined that the most effective means of 
delivering against the requirements remains through implementation of the solution 
proposed at Initial Gate.  
 
b. Judgement Panel convened DATE  resulted in a Procurement Strategy decision 
informed by the Project Team and  DELIVERY ORGANISATION , decided by the user 
and endorsed by Head of Capability Special Projects (HoC SP). The IGBC  
(Enclosure 6)  was approved against the assumption that delivery of capability via 
FMS would ensure the  Threshold  cKURs would be fulfilled.  
 
9. The DT, in conjunction with the user and in collaboration with ORGANISATION  
stakeholders, has used the Assessment phase to identify and verify the most appropriate 
FMS strategy to fulfil the requirement. The procurement strategy for all capability aspects 
has been analysed and assessed within the Investment Appraisal (IA, Enclosure 3) and 
further detailed within the Procurement Strategy (Enclosure 4). Additionally an engineering 
assessment of the platform and sub -systems has been undertaken to demonstrate 
fulfilment of the KURs (Annex A).  
 
Economic  Case  
 
10. During its Concept phase, Project  PROJECT NAME  was determined to best fulfil the 
cKURs through a bespoke UK competition. With concept studies underway in DATE , 
REDACTED identified a platform currently in -service  REDACTED that had the potential  to 
fulfil the Project ’s requirements. Given the disparity between schedule, cost, risk and 
capability across the potential different procurement m odels an MJP was convened . To 
best inform this panel, DELIVERY ORGANISATION  worked alongside ANOTHER 
DELIVERY ORGANISATION  to ensure that each p rocurement  strategy had been similarly 
assessed for Project, Technical and Cost impact and that the p rimary risks of each 
strategy were  highlighted . 
 
11. The MJP’s selected procurement strategy was  the procurement of  DELIVERABLE  
via Foreign Military  Sale (FMS).  This was endorsed  on the IGBC  Outletter  (Enclosure 7).  
 
12. The DT have used the Assessment Phase to engage with a wide range of 
ORGANISATION  stakeholders to gain assurance that the capability offered by 
REDACTED fulfil the Project ’s Objectives. This has been achieved.  
 
13. Following IGBC approval in DATE  the available Courses of Action (CoAs) were 
further developed. They are briefly described below:  
 
a. CoA 1 : Do Nothing . Use the existing post Mid Life Upgrade supported by the 
current through -life support mechanism.  
   b. CoA 2 : Do Minimum. Procure  DELIVERABLE with Capability and  Through Life 
Support aligned to US Model.  
 
c. CoA 3 :  REDACTED with COUNTRY  Modification  & Support . Procure 
DELIVERABLE  complete with  modification of capability to meet UK Key User 
Requirements and an optimum through -life support mechanism. Under th is Option 
DELIVERY ORGANISATION  would REDACTED  with proven in -service capability in 
a similar operating e nvelope via FMS with the ORGANISATION , complete with an 
optimum through -life support mechanism.  This will enable the UK to meet the UK 
specific KURS via the FMS contract. It will result in the delivery of a capability that 
meets and exceeds threshold KURs, provides a clear route to delivery of objective 
KURs and further enables interoperability and collaboration between UK and 
COUNTRY . 
 
d. CoA 4 : UK Bespoke Competition . Competitively design and manufacture a 
fleet of  DELIVERABLES , aiming to maximise  performance towards Objective levels 
as set in the KURs. Support  the DELIVERABLES  with an optimum through -life 
support mechanism.  
 
14. An analysis of each CoA is presented within the IA. This has been informed by 
significant Concept p hase work by  DELIVERY ORGANISATION, the continuation and 
expansion  of that work through the Assessment phase, engagement with 
ORGANISATION  and SOCOM stakeholders and the Project  OTHER PROJECT  Mid Life 
Update Programme.  
 
15. The IA recommended Option 3 to be the most effective means of delivering the 
requirement.  
 
a. CoA 3 provides VfM through  utilisation of  an existing Manufacturing Contract 
providing D&M risk reduction informed by historic NRE and  R&D invested into 
REDACTED.  Alignment of configuration provides a mechanism for  further 
interoperability & collaboration between the UK and COUNTRY , enabling UK 
exploitation of COUNTRY  resource tailored to wards the evolution  and assurance of a 
capability that can  continue to  deliver a battle winning edge through -life. Other CoAs 
cannot provide the same level of access to the considerable resource available when 
partnering closely with the COUNTRY .  
 
b. Short to medium t erm goals to achieve KUR  objective performance levels are 
outlined within the PROJECT NAME  Technology Management Roadmap. Th is 
provides for development and integration of c apabilities that will not only enhance 
Project  PROJECT NAME  but could also be implemented on  REDACTED . The 
development of these capabilities is costed within the FBC and routes to delivery of 
outcomes agreed through partnership with the ORGANISATION , UK and othe r 
stakeholders.  
 
Financial Case  
 
16. Funding for this Project  was approved via Option X (Concept Assessmen t) and 
Option X (Demonstration, Manufacture, In -service, Disposal) . These provided a 10 year 
procurement budget of £ XXXX  to deliver Full Operation Capability for DATE a bespoke UK 
Competition. The procurement timeline was accelerated by FCR  DATE (Enclosure 9) to 
take advantage of an opportunity to deliver the Project  at better VfM whilst also bringing 
forward IOC and FOC dates by X years.  
   17. As per paragraph 3p implementation of FCR  DATE  ensures that the Project is 
affordable, with the Approval Value requested within this FBC aligning with Control Total 
(CT). The Procurement Strategy developed by the PT realised efficiencies of £ XXXX  
through -life including £ XXXX  through Design & Manufacture Phases resulting from 
minimal NRE Costs; FCR implementation has amended both the CAPEX profile and the 
OPEX shortfall required to successfully deliver this Project and removed the efficiencies 
from Project CT.  
 
18. The FMS Case has informed a cost forecast based on firm ‘ceiling’ prices calculated 
by the COUNTRY Procurement Authority. The DT has engaged routinely with them  to 
ensure that COUNTRY  Cost Assumptions and the COUNTRY  built-in risk are well 
understood. These costs have informed the (3 Point Estimate (3PE)) Best Case  and Most 
Likely  Cost Data Assumptions within the Cost Model with additional uncertainty factored 
into Worst Case estimates; UK specific Risk costings have been calculated and included 
within the Cost Model output. This has resulted in a robust model, reviewed and assessed 
by the PT, COUNTRY Procurement Authority  and the  Independent CAAS Approvals Team 
(CAT) . 
 
19. Project Risks are identified and their impacts costed through the  DELIVERY 
ORGANISATION  Risk Management tool and Project  PROJECT NAME  Cost Model; this 
process has identified a RIC. of £ XXXX  and ROC of £ XXXX . Although this RIC appears 
low value it is in addition to  COUNTRY  Risk assumptions factored into the Project 3PE 
within the Cost Model.  
 
20. RIC and ROC have been identified using the Probabilistic (Monte Carlo) method; the 
modelled risk between P10 and P50 identifies the total RIC and the modelled risk between 
P50 and P90 identifies the total ROC.  
21. OB and SRA are red as a result  of the narrow delivery dates. The D T consider this 
acceptable as the DELIVERABLE  to be procur ed will be manufactured on an established 
production line  producing DELIVERABLE  to the same specification as the 
ORGANISATION , with minimal variation to fulfil limited UK specific requirements.  
 
22. The Approving Authority is requested to note the e stimated cost forecast from IGBC 
submission  at Table 3 below .

£XXXX  RDEL and £ XXXX  of RMC.  Any subsequent variance following receipt of the LOA 
shall be rectified via PCR.  
Commercial Case  
 
24. Procurement strategy for this project is  to purchase  DELIVERABLE  through an FMS 
contract with ORGANISATION . The awarded c ontract (via L oR / LoA) will include support 
for 2 years  following delivery of the final DELIVERABLE .    
25. Procurement via FMS is outside the scope of Procurement Regulations,  therefore 
this Project was not  advertised in the Defence Contracts Online (DCO) .  The lack of 
requirement for a competition and prototype assessment  has significantly reduce d delivery 
timescales . 
 
26. The DT have consulted Central Legal Services and received confirmation that there 
are sufficient grounds for reliance on the Defence and Security Public Contracts 
Regulations exclusion at Reg 7(1)(h) which provides an exemption for FMS.

Management Case  
 
28. Governance . 
a. Project  PROJECT NAME  will be managed in -service by  DELIVERY 
ORGANISATION . 
 
b. Project Deliverables are being managed via a resourced Project Schedule 
which defines the activities and milestones and ensures the P T are accountable for 
progress against the Baseline. Schedule Risk Analysis has been undertaken and has 
been used to inform the FBC.  
 
c. A Project Management Plan (PMP) and Stakeholder Management and 
Governance Strategy  (Enclosure 11)  have been produced and are actively employed 
to ensure all Stakeholders are identified and th at the  PT correctly understand and 
employ a defined process towards delivery of the requirement.  
 
d. The milestones and schedule for the Demonstration and Manufacture phase are 
shown at Annex C.  
 
29. Key personnel . 
 
a. The Project Sponsor is ROLE . 
 
b. The Senior Responsible Officer (SRO) will be ROLE.  
   c. Project Executive Officer (PEO), exercising delegated responsibility of the SRO 
will be ROLE.  
 
30. In-Service Support Solution.  
 
a. Collaborative engagement .  REDACED  and LFE from the current support 
Contract has informed the Integrated Logistic Support Management Strategy 
(ILSMP)2 forming the basis for US Contract negotiations.  
 
b. The strategy determines the best model for support within the constraints of 
FMS is to contract through the ORGANISATION  an enabling agreement between the 
OEM  and a UK support contractor to deliver a support package for the commercially 
available equipment, with direct ORGANISATION  support for the more sensitive, 
controlled items. This model shall ensure that reachback to the OEM is available for 
maintainers and DELIVERY ORGANISATION  for the critical first years (to DATE ) the 
capability is in -service. Subsequently the support of commercial elements shall be 
competed as part of a wider competition for support whilst Controlled Items identified 
within the LOA shall be supported through subsequent FMS Cases. Should it be 
assessed as more cost effective the opportunity remains to support the total 
capability via FMS.  
 
31. Project Team Staffing.  
 
a. The PT is adequately resourced for management of this Project with FTE posts 
being prioritised within the Team in the short to medium term whilst ongoing 
recruitment is completed. Where specific technical expertise is required the PT are 
successfully contracting via the EDP, primarily to deliver Security Assurance 
Coordinator and Technical Through -Life Support resourcing. Although the PT is 
utilising PSS resource whilst recruiting Crown Civil Servants costs  remain within the 
PSS CT3 and implementation of FCR has ensured the required SQEP resource is 
affordable through -life. 
 
32. Capability Integration Plan (CIP).  Capability  integration across DLoDs is being 
managed through a Capability Transition and Integration Working Group (CTIWG)  and will 
be reviewed by bi-annual pan-stakeholder  Project Boards. This includes a Capability 
Roadmap which details the pan -DLOD transition from Project  OTHER PROJECT  to 
Project  PROJECT NAME . The CIP is at Enclosure 12.  Particular consideration is being 
applied to personnel and infrastructure where studies have been conducted and planning 
in place to achieve outputs by IOC.  
a. Infrastructure.  A permanent Infra solution, under OTHER PROJECT , is 
unfunded and currently unaffordable. ORGANISATION are working with  
ORGANISATION and PT to develop a temporary and subsequently permanent infra 
solution. This includes potential use of  REDACTED and smaller, cost effective 
upgrades to  DELIVERABLE. A decision will be made prior to IAB of the preferred 
Infra COA.  
 
b. Personnel.  ORGANISATION c urrently does not have  sufficient REDACTED to 
support this capability. As part of a wider review ORGANISATION have submitted 
their requirements to feed into a ABC DATE  Option for manpower uplift. Work is also 
being carried out to recognise the requirement. As contingency ORGANISATION is 
 
 
   able to surge internal manpower to meet any operational requirements, although this 
would add significant pressure to REDACTED . 
 
c. Acceptance and Development. First of Class Trials (FoCT)  will take place for 
DELIVERABLES  1 and 2  using Integrated Test, Evaluation and Acceptance Plan 
(ITEAP) . This is being developed to ensure user confidence in the DELIVERABLE  
ability to meet a range of mission objectives . The customer will prioritise which other 
capability interfaces will be physically trialled during the C apability Development and 
Integration Period (CDIP). At the end of FoCT , CDIP  and acceptance of 
DELIVERABLES  IOC will be declared.  
 
d. Safety. A project safety strateg y is being developed to detail  the process to be 
adopted  to manage safety and environmental protection (S&EP), along with 
legislative requirements and  to articulate  S&EP roles and responsibilities . A Platform 
Safety  and Environmental Committee will be  established, and a Preliminary Safety 
and Environmental Case Report developed prior to DELIVERABLE  acceptance for 
CDIP. The final SECR will be signed when the capability is declared Operating Safely 
once all DLoD considerations are satisfied.  
 
33. Risks.  Project Risks are maintained in accordance with DELIVERY ORGANISATION  
Policy on SOFTWARE NAME  and managed through a robust process for assessment, 
analysis, mitigation and escalation. Key Project Risks have been identified at Annex B.  
 
34. Capability Enhancement and Sustainment.  To ensure PROJECT NAME  continues 
to perform at the front edge of technology and exploit a battle winning edge a Technology 
Management Roadmap has been developed which identifies requirements for and 
implementing the further R&D and T&E of capabilities additional to those immediately 
delivered by the FMS case. Both independent UK technology development and 
collaboration with the COUNTRY  will provide the means to mitigate current and future 
Risks to the capability.
