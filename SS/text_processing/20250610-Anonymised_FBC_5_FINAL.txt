NAME OF PROJECT  Full Business Case, Category D  
Executive Summary  
NAME OF PROJECT project will  procure  a single class of NUMBER OF  
replacement DELIVERABLES for the NAME OF DEPARTMENT . NAME OF PROJECT  
will provide a solution to meet NAME OF DEPARTMENT ’s enhance d operational 
objectives , which the current DELIVERABLE  are no longer capable of supporting . 
The Outline Business Case (OBC)  approved  procurement of NAME OF PROJECT  
via competitive tender , represent ing the best Value of Money (VfM) option to  meet 
NAME OF DEPARTMENT’s  Key User Requirements (KUR s). Following receipt of 
Best and Final Offer (BAFO) submissions  in DATE , COMPANY  have been selected 
as the preferred tenderer . NAME OF OTHER DEAPARTMENT Team are  therefore  
seeking approv al through Full Business Case (FBC) to award a contract  to 
COMPANY  at a cost model output of  £XXXX  (VAT inc)  against a Control Total of 
£XXXX . This represents an efficiency /saving against CT  of £XXXX   
Issue  
1. Approval is required to commence the manufacture  phase of  the NAME OF 
PROJECT  project . 
2. The current DELIVERABLE  utilised by the NAME OF DEPARTMENT  are reaching  
or have surpassed their  Out of Service Date (OSD)  and no longer meet KURs . 
Procurement of replacement DELIVERABLE s is essential to ensur e operational outputs 
are maintained.   
Timing  
3. Routine.  FBC Approval is requested by DATE  to allow Contract Award DATE . This 
is in line with  Tenderer's expectations , so meeting this  minimises the risk of delay to 
DELIVERABLE  delivery  if a delayed contract award were to occur . 
 
Recommendation(s)  
4. The Approving Authority  is invited to approv e: 
a. The NAME OF PROJECT  project proceeding to manufacture phase in order to 
deliver the KURs at Annex A;  
b. The Approved Budgetary Level (outturn, inclusive  of all non -recoverable VAT) 
at 50% confidence for the Manufacture phase  up until DATE is £XXXX

5. And to note:  
a. Affordability against the approved Control Total across all Financial Years has 
been confirmed by CUSTOMER . 
b. The VAT treatment has been confirmed as being F1 for the build programme  
c. No Private Sector Support (PSS) is required to support this approval.    
d. There are no Contingent Liabilities  associated with any Contract resulting from 
this approval .  
e. The principal  risks to capability delivery  at Annex  C. 
f. Two contractual options are available to offer flexibility to the Authority , but are 
excluded from this approval : 
(1) £XXXX  (VAT Inc) for the procurement of up to an additional NUMBER 
OF Option DELIVERABLE  (currently unaffordable ); 
(2) £XXXX (VAT inc) for  In-Service Support (I SS) up to DATE  
(a) ISS is excluded from this approval. Funding provision for NAME OF 
PROJECT  ISS has been accounted for and approved within the 
Approved Budgetary Level ( ABL) of the DELIVERABLE s In-Service 
Support (ISS) contract. Initial ISS for NAME OF PROJECT , until DATE , 
will be conducted by either COMPANY  (if the option is enacted) or the 
current ISS provider. Enduring ISS, post DATE , will be conducted by the 
Future ISS (FISS)  contractor following tender outcome.  FISS represents 
the follow -on support contract after expiry of the current arrangements in 
DATE . All ISS funding for NAME OF PROJECT  is approved within 
ISS/FISS and as such is excluded from this approval .     
 
Case Narrative   
Strategic Case  
6. The NAME OF PROJECT  Project seeks to continue the enduring requirement for 
NAME OF DEPARTMENT  to deliver ongoing waterborne patrol and policing at 
(LOCATION 1 , LOCATION 2 , and LOCATION 3 ). The  current suite of DELIVERABLE  
delivering these operations are progressing to or have surpassed their OSD , and in the 
majority of cases are no longer suitable for the operations they are used for  as a result of 
changes in  user operational objectives and scope growth . This has mean t that 
DELIVERABLE  once suitable for operations are now unsuitable . The NAME OF 
PROJECT  project is therefore required to enable users to effectively fulfil their 
operational tasks  including : 
a. REDACTED  
b. REDACTED  
c. REDACTED  
d. REDACTED  
7. In order to deliver these requirements, NAME OF DEPARTMENT  require 
DELIVERABLE  for the provision of REDACTED.  In doing so they provide REDACTED.  
8. The project was initially established in  DATE , with the scope to deliver 
DELIVERABLES  variants across NUMBER  user communities . Due to efforts of 
rationalisation and a need to reduce complexity, the project was split into two separate 
projects : Medium and Large DELIVERABLE . The medium requirement is a procurement 
for NUMBER DELIVERABLE s, however due to both resource and funding constraints 
this project has been paused ; NAME OF PROJECT  represents the  large  variant . 
9. The Outline Business Case for NAME OF PROJECT was approved in DATE  and 
approved the commencement of a zero -cost assessment phase to procure NUMBER 
NAME OF PROJECT (out of a total requirement of NUMBER  DELIVERABLE s) at 
£XXXX . In DATE , a Contract Notice was issued for the procurement of NUMBER  NAME 
OF PROJECT DELIVERABLE . Due to resource constraints and CUSTOMER  re-
prioritisation,  the NAME OF PROJECT  tender competition was paused until DATE . In 
DATE , prior to Contract notice re -release , a review of the project costings suggested that 
it was possible to purchase NUMBER  NAME OF PROJECT  for a forecast cost of £ XXXX . 
As such a revised contract notice and PQQ was released in D ATE which scoped for the 
procurement of NUMBER  NAME OF PROJECT  DELIVERABLE . This revise d scope  
increased the User groups  to re-align the scope more closely to the original intent of  the 
NAME OF PROJECT  project (to procure DELIVERABLE  for multiple users) . Following 
receipt of unaffordable tenders in DATE , the scope was again reduced to procuring 
NUMBER DELIVERABLES  for the sole user group of NAME OF DEPARTMENT , 
following CUSTOMER  approval1. A summary of the change in DELIVERABLE  allocation , 
including mitigations for users no longer in scope of NAME OF PROJECT , is outlined in 
Table 3: 
REDACTED  
 
     
 
 Table 3 – NAME OF PROJECT  DELIVERABLE  Allocation  
10. The DELIVERABLE  made  redundant  by the introduction of NAME OF PROJECT  
(depending on the class and condition ) will either be directly disposed  of or on occasions 
where DELIVERABLE  may still be operational, will be reallocated to  allow disposal  or 
removal from service  of other DELIVERABLE . In some instances, DELIVERABLE  are 
likely to fill capability gaps . 
Economic Case  
11. During  OBC  approval in YEAR , several options to determine VfM were assessed. 
The outcome of the OBC Option s analysis  concluded that Option 4 would provide  the 
best VfM solution , as detailed below:  
a. Option 4  - Competitive tender for build of a single class of replacement 
DELIVERABLE  with potential through -life support arrangements offered following 
conclusion of VfM exercise post contract award (decision to be made post -contract 
award whether to transfer the offsite support into the ISS and/or BES contracts).  
 
12. The Procurement and Commercial Strategy recommended that this be achieved 
through engagement in open competition with industry to select a preferred bidder. This 
competition has since  been completed using the Competitive Negotiated procedure 
under the Defence and Security Public Contact Regulations ( DSPCR 2011 ) regulations, 
resulting in the receipt of two tenders.  
13. To determine which tender offered the best VfM , the Most Economically 
Advantageous  Tender (MEAT) was selected  using the Value for Money Index 
methodology.  This approach divide d the total score of the non -cost (quality) criteria by 
the tender cost.  It was simple to calculate, transparent, and maximise d return on 
investment.  
14. In addition to supporting a n overall  VfM solution, an efficiency will be found by 
supporting just 1 class of DELIVERABLE , versus  the current model where five classes 
perform these duties. This not only will allow for a  more  efficient and simplified support  
regime, but also  release s extant  DELIVERABLE  for use elsewher e, improv ing overall  
availability of DELIVERABLE  for other users . 
a. Moreover, i nteroperability efficiencies ar e gained through use of one class of 
DELIVERABLE  at REDACTED  locations. The project will employ technologies 
being employed in the DELIVERABLE . 
15. As previously outlined , ISS is excluded from this approval.  This decision was made 
as learning from experience across the DELIVERABLE s Acquisition and I SS Programme 
shows that V fM is obtained for non -complex /Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS)  
DELIVERABLE s by purchasing without ISS.  To demonstrate  and ensure  VfM, the award 
of the ISS element of the project  will be competed between the current ISS provider and 
the DELIVERABLE  Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) , COMPANY .  
Commercial Case  
16. This procurement will be awarded using the negotiated procedure under Regulation 
18 of the Defence & Security Public Contract Regulations (DSPCR) 2011 (the     
 
“Negotiated Procedure”).  This allowed for face-to-face discussions and clarifications of 
each tenderer’s proposal.  
17. In-line with the NAME OF PROJECT  Procurement Strategy , the Authority launched 
a competitive tender in DATE , later re -released in  DATE , for the procurement of the  
NAME OF PROJECT  DELIVERABLE . The Preliminary Qualification Questionnaire 
(PQQ)  yielded NUMBER OF  responses  from industry,  of which 6 successful potential 
providers were invited through to the Invitation To Negotiate (ITN) stage , which 
commenced in DATE . The tender  included  a Statement of Technical Requirements 
(SOTR), Contractual Terms & Conditions and a set of Contract Evaluation Criteria that 
was designed to establish the Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT) from 
assessment of bidders’ responses . Following  evaluation of  the ITN submissions, 2 
tenders were received,  and both were assessed as compliant  in proposing solutions 
which meet the outline d requirements.  
18. In order to  best achieve the required capability within funding constraints, the 
contract contained a well -defined firm requirement for  NUMBER OF  NAME OF 
PROJECT , with the option for an addition al NUMBER OF  NAME OF PROJECT  if funding 
became available.  The contract will be awarded using a combination of Firm and Fixed 
prices. For the requirements subject to a Fixed price , the price will be agreed u nder a 
Variation of Price (VOP) clause linked to the HQT I price index, as agreed with Defence 
Economics .  
19. Payment will be made via Contracting, Purchasing & Finance (CP&F) upon delivery 
of individual DELIVERABLE s, spares packages and other contractual 
deliverables.  Payments will be made in accordance with the agreed Milestone s which 
have been identified and  defined within the contract and will cover work completed to the 
satisfaction of the NAME OF DEPARTMENT  during the design and manufacture phases . 
20. Suitable Intellectual Property (IP) DEFCONs have been included in the contract to 
enable any contractor nominated by the Authority to carry out future support.   
21. The contract is DEFCON based with narrative conditions.   
22. COMPANY  is not a recognised strategic supplier and Defence Equipment & 
Support ( NAME OF OTHER DEAPARTMENT ) has partial exemption from the Cabinet 
Office Spend Control approval , which applies to this procurement as it is under the 
thres hold of £XXXX  (ex VAT) . 
23. There are no Contingent Liabilities  associated with any Contract resulting from this 
approval .  
 
Financial Case   
24. The Approved Budgetary Level (ABL) being sought within this approval (outturn, 
inclusive of all non -recoverable VAT at 50% confidence) for Manufacture consists of:  
a. £XXXX  capital expenditure (CDEL) ; 
b. £XXXX  total resource consumption (RDEL) . 
25. This falls within the current CUSTOMER  Control Total approved for this project 
phase of £XXXX . This represents an efficiency of £ XXXX  for CUSTOMER .      
 
26. This is in addition to the in-service support provision  already  approved as part of the 
ISS MGBC CUSTOMER  Allocation (£XXXX  CDEL; £XXXX  RDEL ). 
27. The ISS OBC approved in -service support provision until DATE . Approval for NAME 
OF PROJECT  in-service support beyond this date will be incorporated into the approval 
for FISS . 
28. Affordability of the project is demonstrated in Table 4 below  (inclusive of Risk) , 
overall affordability within the wider DELIVERABLE s programme can be found at Annex

Table 5 - NAME OF PROJECT  Affordability Table against PCR2 -DATE  
29. The project is delivering an overall efficiency of £ XXXX  against the Near Cash 
Control Total allocated to it. However, there are affordability challenges in certain 
Financial Years, resulting from the build programme being accele rated compared to the 
original assumptions. This acceleration has been agreed with the SRO  and 
ORGANISATION  via an Information Note. It also  delivers capability to the user more 
expediently and delivers the cost efficiency by reducing inflation risk in later years.  
30. All RDEL costs for ISS are out -of-scope of this approval, as NAME OF PROJECT  
Support Costs are affordable within the current scope of the ISS contract and approval as 
demonstrated by the table below. In -service support pr

32. It should be noted that the variances in RDEL do not represent an efficiency but will 
be recycled within the entirety of the ISS portfolio.  
33. All costs incurred during this project will be charged to NAME OF DEPARTMENT  in 
Pounds Sterling .     
 
34. The correct VAT and accounting treatment applications have been applied and 
have been assured . 
35. NAME OF OTHER DEAPARTMENT Commercial have confirmed that there are no 
contingent liabilities . 
36. There is no Private Sector Support (PSS) expenditure associated with this approval.  
37. Raw Materials and Consumables (RMC) – expenditure will be apportioned from the 
value approved in the ISS OBC, as these DELIVERABLE s will be directly replacing 
platforms for which RMC expenditure was included for the full duration of that approval. It 
is not anticipated that there will be either notable savings or uplift to the planned RMC 
expenditure compared to the assumptions made under that approval.  
Management Case  
38. A planning assumption for service entry between DATE  and DATE  is currently 
predicted to be met with 50% confidence .

Table 7 – Project Milestone  Estimates  
40. Definitions for ISD, IOC and FOC  are defined at Annex E. 
a. Dates  presented in Table 7 re flect the output of the Schedule Risk Analysis 
(SRA) conducted  by NAME OF OTHER DEAPARTMENT against COMPANY ’s 
proposed DELIVERABLE  delivery schedule, hence have an appropriate risk 
provision included . Table 7 therefore  differ s from the DELIVERABLE  delivery 
schedule outlined in Annex B which does not have  NAME OF OTHER 
DEAPARTMENT  project risks applied but will be the profile used for the purpose of 
financial forecasting.  
41. The NAME OF PROJECT  programme is currently fully resourced as it remains one 
of the higher -priority projects within the DELIVERABLE s Acquisition Programme. 
Meanwhile, other projects (notably those where procurement action has not yet started, 
and which are deemed lower priority by the Customer) are not progressing because the 
team’s resource is focussed on these higher -priority projects.  
a. Delivery of NAME OF PROJECT  is dependent  on the DELIVERABLE s team 
retaining its current re source which  includ es both  PDP and CDP  personnel. If these 
are lost, there is a risk that NAME OF PROJECT  will not be fully resourced  as both 
FISS and acquisition projects will be  prioritised.   
42. COMPANY  is based in LOCATION 10, which is less than 1 day travel from NAME 
OF OTHER DEAPARTMENT . T&S expenditure associated with  visiting this location is  
therefore  anticipated to be negligible . There  will be a requirement to visit SUPPLIER  
manufacturing facility in LOCATION , however travel  to this site  is considered  comparable     
 
in price to UK internal flights or rail travel  and is therefore  considered to be affordable 
within the DELIVERABLE s teams OPEX budget.  
43. The principal risks at this stage are listed below, with full detail contained in Annex 
C: 
a. There is a risk that the infrastructure to allow storage and refilling of petrol for 
DELIVERABLE  assigned to LOCATION 1  will not be in place by DATE . 
b. There is a risk that design changes post -Contract Award (due to either a 
misinterpretation of the requirement, or a change in the User Requirement) will 
result in cost increases and/or time delays as the contractual requirement is 
amended.  
c. There is a risk that the project will not have enough resource to deliver its 
outcome, especially in the engineering and commercial space.  
d. There is a risk that ISS will not be av ailable to meet ISD and DELIVERABLE  1 
delivery . 
44. NAME OF PROJECT  is a majority COTS product which encompasses minor 
variations in the CAPABILITY  system to meet the specific user requirements identified by 
the NAME OF DEPARTMEN T. Given this, it is acknowledged that the risk associated 
with a new DELIVERABLE  manufacture will be reduced as  data on the expected 
performance and previous usage of th e COTS DELIVERABLE , forming the basis for 
NAME OF PROJECT , already exists.  In upholding a majority COTS product, this also 
gives confidence in COMPANY ’s ability to meet the given requirements as they have 
already demonstrated their ability to manufacture a DELIVERABLE  which has met a 
significant proportion of these parameters.  
a. DELIVERABLE  acceptance will be carried out in accordance with the  project  
ITEAP to ensure performance is verified against the requirements and COMPANY ’s 
proposed solution . 
b. The full scope of the  NAME OF PROJECT  project  includes the DELIVERABLE  
and associated equipment and documentation : Supportability Documentation, 
Training, Security  and NAME OF PROJECT  Model.  
45. Formal NAME OF OTHER DEAPARTMENT  Project Evaluations will be carried out 
by ORGANISATION  DELIVERABLE s team  at the following times:  
a. Within one month of acceptanc e; 
b. Within one month of attaining FOC ; 
c. Into the in -service support phase ; 
d. Within one month of the project end date.  
 
46. Informal Learning from Experience (LFE) sessions will be held throughout the 
lifetime of this project , which will be used to manage both this project and other 
acquisition projects being managed by the Authority.  
47. The classification of information and other security risks for this project through 
assessment and direction are not deemed to be high, security working groups have been 
held through the process. Security improvement was included as part of the tender     
 
process ; bidders were asked to provide information on how they would improve the 
security of the DELIVERABLE  and provide detail of their Security Management Plan , 
which was assessed by a DELIVERABLE s Team Security specialist. The project is 
currently working through the new “Secure by Design” process and regular working group 
meetings will be held throughout the next stage of NAME OF PROJECT . 
48. All project DLODs have been identified and have been engaged throughout the life 
of the project. A series of DLOD Working Groups  (e.g. CIWGS, ITEAP WG, TSG)  will be 
established  and conducted in -line with an agreed drumbeat , in support of progression to  
completion of DELIVERABLE  first of class and enduring engagement to  achieve NAME 
OF PROJECT  IOC and FOC.  Additional mee tings where required  may be organised to 
discuss  specific  DLOD  issues , with ongoing monitoring via RAG reviews  being conducted  
as per the DELIVERABLE s Team governance process2. 
Presentation and Handling  
49. There are no presentational and handling issues associated with  NAME OF 
PROJECT  and COMPANY . COMPANY  are a  LOCATION -based company and therefore 
awarding a contract which will be managed from this location supports the government ’s 
“Levelling -Up” agenda.  It should be noted however that COMPANY ’s production facility is 
based in LOCATION .
