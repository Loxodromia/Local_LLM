Executive Summary  
The (NAME OF PROJECT)  programme will provide PROGRAMME PURPOSE . 
Learning lessons from the  PREVIOUS PROGRAMME  procurement, the 
manufacture competition allowed international firms to partner with UK 
companies.  It also allowed bidding consortia to cost/capability trade within a 
defined envelope. This process has allowed the procurement to maximise 
competitive leverage and deliver a compliant result at pace.  The competition 
outcome is to appoint a  Preferred Bidder to finalise a bespoke negotiated 
contract for the three DELIVERABLE S; delivering the first DELIVERABLE  in 
DATE  and all three DELIVERALBE DELIVERABLES  by DATE . The Preferred 
Bidder ’s proposal maximises the benefits of adaptability for future role s. It also 
delivers both reduced cost of ownership and carbon intensity through life. 
DELIVERABLES will be in service post trials by DATE . 
The outcome aligns to the National INDUSTRY  Strategy ( INDUSTRY )Strategy 
refresh and the Defence Security and Industrial Strategy  through significant 
capital investment in UK LOCATIONS  to increase industrial productivity and the 
development of the UK supply chain and workforce skills whilst also meeting 
testing environmental objectives. In sum mary , it delivers the capability agreed 
by the COMMAND  ORGANISATION  and the JROC within the pre -determined 
budget whilst also meeting wider Government policy objectives; particularly 
with respect to investment in new INDUSTRY  jobs, skills and facilities.  
 
Issue  
1.   Approval to commit to the Demonstration & Manufacture (D&M) Phase for th e 
(NAME OF PROJECT)  capability within the described Performance, Cost, Time, and 
Risk parameters.  
Recommendations  
2. The IAC is invited to approve : 
a. an Approved Budgetary Level (ABL) of £XXXX  (at outturn, inclusive  of 
all non -recoverable VAT) at 50% confidence , for the Demonstration and 
Manufacture  Phase consisting of ; 
 i. £XXXX  total resource consumption (RDEL)  
 
  ii. £XXXX  capital expenditure (CDEL)  
   
 
  
b. placement of the Manufacture Contract with the Preferred Bidder , for 3 
DELIVERABLES , with a  forecast  contract  value of £ XXXX1 CDEL , including an 
Integrated Logistic Support (ILS) package of initial training and spares, and a 
programme of UK LOCATION  Recapitalisation and Social Value ; 
c. the In-Service Date (ISD) of DELIVERABLE  1, DATE  at 70% c onfidence ; 
d. the Key User Requirements (KURs) at Annex A.   
3. And to note: 
a. the intent  to appoint the Preferred Bidder by end of DATE  to allow them 
to mobilise and secure essential infrastructure funding.  The P referred Bidder’s  
proposal is predic ated on a significant UK LOCATION  recap italisation  
programme of which  a large proportion is to be privately funded , with the 
catalyst for  securing this funding being  their appointment as Preferred Bidde r. 
Unsuccessful Bidder s will be notified in parallel ;  
b. the 10%, 50%, 90% confidence levels for the cost of the  programme  
phase s:

f. that the In-Service  Support solution will be assessed and delivered 
through the TLB Support Integrated Global Network programme , alongside the 
rest of the DELIVERABLE S, with the ESP costs (totalling £XXXX  at 50% 
confidence across the capability expected duration ) being provisioned within 
the (NAME OF PROJECT)  S9 line ; and 
 
g. the principal risks for the Manufacture Phase at Annex G. 
 
Timing  
 
4. Priority. Manufacture contract award is required as soon as practicable on  the 
complet ion of  the Preferred Bidder phase and approvals but no later than the 
expiration of the bid validity period on xx xx DATE , after which the Preferred Bidder is 
not obliged to hold its prices. Manufacture contract award is required as soon as 
practicable on  the complet ion of  the Preferred Bidder phase and approvals but no later 
than the expiration of the bid validity period on xx xx   DATE , after which the Preferred 
Bidder is not obliged to hold its prices. The Preferred Bidder’s proposal is very mature 
and has been  scrutinised in detail, moving at pace is low risk and enables early 
investment in facilities, s kills etc. Delay would risk escalation due to inflation and 
exposure to rapidly changing foreign exchange movements.   
 
Strategic Case  
 
5. (NAME OF PROJECT)  is a TLB Strategic Programme required to deliver the 
Command Plan objective OBJECTIVES . It is a key logistics enabler, for REDACTED . 
 
6. Legacy DELIVERABLES  are beyond their design life and unable to provide the 
capability at the required performance levels particularly for capacity and storage 
efficiency, and in an assured manner to meet policy. PREVIOUS DELIVERABLES  
were already X years old and have a DATED CAPABILITES . Their immediate 
retirement was confirmed as part of Integrated Review XXX. This has left  the 
FORMER DELIVERABLE , as the only DELIVERABLE  until the entry into service of 
(NAME OF PROJECT) . Not only does this result in a single point of failure, vested in 
DATED CAPABILITIES  but there will clearly be periods of planned unavailability when 
undertaking maintenance. REMOVED INFORMATION ABOUT PREVIOUS 
DELIVERABLES . 
 
7. A capability cliff edge is approaching with PREVIOUS DELIVERABLE  due to 
leave service in DATE . (NAME OF PROJECT)  ISDs are expected DATES , with more 
detailed work required to refine and expedite the OTHER PROGRAMME  now that a 
delivery schedule is confirmed . An Option (xxxx) has been raised  to PREVIOUS 
DELIVERABLE  to the end of her current survey cycle in XX DATE  to align with the 
(NAME OF PROJECT)  delivery schedule and further mitigate the transition period , at   
 
  
a cost of c .£XXXX. The provision for t his mitigation was directed  by the IAC at OBC , 
with the expectation that TLB will implement during ABC DATE . Further run-on would 
incur significant (>£ XXXX) nugatory cost which is to be avoided with all efforts 
focussed on achieving contract award no later than XX DATE , maintaining the (NAME 
OF PROJECT)  delivery schedule  whilst on contract  and making the OTHER 
PROGRAMME  as efficient as p ossible . 
 
8. Requirements/Solution  - The KURs are at Annex A  for which  JROC  
endorsement has been sought , as at least the  threshold requirements set at OBC have 
been met. The Competitive Procurement Phase ( CPP) has included an extensive 
examination of the winning design against the KURs. This process has been verified 
by Scrutiny and validates the assessment that the proposed design will meet the 
necessary capability requirement . These are underpinned by the REDACTED  
requirements. In addition, this process has also included an examination of the 
DELIVERABLES  adaptability. XX through their FEATURES  are used for a variety of 
tasks out -with their core capability role, and the features of the winning (NAME OF 
PROJECT)  design echo this intent. The assessment demonstrates that the winning 
design can be effectively adapted to remain capable through its envisaged X-year life 
span. A summary  of the design is at Annex B.  
 
9. CSG DATE  reinforced the importance of CAPABILITY  when operating at reach. 
Many of the le ssons had already been incorporated within the  (NAME OF PROJECT)  
requirement by IMPROVED CAPABILTY  in the objective space . The prominent lesson 
was the need to take sufficient DELIVERABLES . REDACTED  was heavily relied on to 
supplement the PREDECESSOR.  This validates the concept of deploying 
DELIVERABLES  in sufficient numbers (min. 2 XXX and 2 (NAME OF PROJECT) ) to 
give the operational flexibility, capacity and the (NAME OF PROJECT)  consolidation 
model would take the DATED CAPABILTY  from the PREDECESSOR  which are n ot 
designed for this REDACTED . 
 
10. Summary of Benefits  - (NAME OF PROJECT)  delivers c rucial  strategic 
defence and national benefit. It is the final capability piece to sustain NAME OF 
GROUP  Groups and exploit REDACTED  investment, it is the enabler for long term 
transformation of INDUSTRY  to deliver the future DELIVERABLE  pipeline . It also 
delivers a platform which could be adapted to potentially achieve very low -carbon 
emissions. (NAME OF PROJECT)  benefits were agreed through a series of 
workshops with key stakeholders , including customers in TLB and INDUSTRY  Support 
organisations, utilising the themes of Operational Capability, Supportability, 
Sustainability and Social Value.   The Benefits Dependency Network provides the 
mapping from the specific project outputs to the programme outcomes and through to 
the final expected strategic end benefits, demonstrating how project led changes will 
contribute to strategic objectives. Benefits Profiles with a reporting process have been 
produced to allow the Customer at contractor Project Delivery Boards  and the MOD 
Programme Board to track the delivery of benefits through manufacture and into 
service.  
 
 
 
 
Economic Case    
 
  
 
11. VFM  - The competition has ensured the best possible outcome for Defence by 
driving out unnecessary cost whilst maximising capability for a price that was fixed 
through competitive tension. The competition received three final bids. The winning 
bid meets all t he required benefits and KURs, including future adaptability and open 
system architecture.  
 
12. As described in the Procurement Strategy , a period of Market Engagement was 
conducted with a wide range of industry participants . The aim of this was to test what 
the market could deliver against the high -level requirements, price point  as well as  
receive feedback to reduce bespoke requirements and cost drivers to a minimum. This 
was followed by a funded C PP which allowed those Bidders who had successfully pre -
qualified at PQQ stage to develop their solutions whilst simultaneously negotiating a 
bespoke Manufacture Contract. The Procurement Strategy covering the CPP and the 
evaluation matrix was endorsed by IAC at OBC in DATE .  
 
13.  Social Value - Social Value evaluation criteria were included as an important 
part of the competition ’s evaluation  model and were weighted such that the minimum 
threshold of 10%  which applied at the time of the procurement ’s launch  was exceeded  
(12% applied) . Specific Social Value engagements were held with Bidders during the 
competition . Note, that the launch of the (NAME OF PROJECT)  procurement pre -
dated the strategy r efresh commitment for a 20% Social Value weighting in all future 
MOD INDUSTRY  procurements.  
 
14. The criteria  reflected existing  Departmental themes  in line with the Cabinet 
Office Social Value model , and where appropriate , specifically tailored  to address 
important Ministerial priorities , the strategy  and to reflect pan-Government policies . 
This included criteria to incentivise Bidders to make capital investments in physical 
infrastructure upgrades  and the use of the UK supply chain to ensure UK content  is 
maximised . Classification of the project  as exempt from  procurement  regulations 
afforded flexibility which the project team maximised in constructing the criteria.  The 
criteria developed  was bespoke and project specific, recognising the nature of the UK 
industry and supply market  and the project’s constraints , particularly  around 
affordability.  
 
15. Annex C  (LIMDIS)  summarises  the Preferred Bidder’s solution to deliver UK 
Social Value under the contract in response to the competition’s criteria. This will 
deliver:  
• A new capability through a £ XXXX recapitalisation investment  in the UK, of 
which £ XXXX is funded  from Private Venture (PV ) sources . 
• Technology and skills transfer to the UK based on international best practice 
and a proven approach , including productivity initiatives  and a Train the Trainer  
methodology .  
• Over 60% of contract spend in the UK, including in the UK supply chain . 
• A significant level of new employment . 
• A British design  and ILS package . 
This significant investment is required  to deliver (NAME OF PROJECT)  to time and 
cost and will help to grow the UK INDUSTRY  capability and capacity and supports the   
 
  
programme aim of enabling  choice for the procurement of follow -on non-complex 
DELIVERABLES  in the INDUSTRY  pipeline . 
 
Commercial  Case  
 
16. The Commercial Strategy for (NAME OF PROJECT)  broadly follow ed the 
successful approach adopted for PREVIOUS PROGRAMME , namely,  to allow the 
Bidders the flexibility to negotiate a bespoke set of terms and conditions . This was 
deemed especially relevant given the previous (NAME OF PROJECT)  competition did 
not allow Bidders to propose amendments and tailor a  bespoke contract . The (NAME 
OF PROJECT)  procurement also  allow ed additional time at the front end of the 
competition  for Bidders to engage and build relationships with LOCATION  given the 
(NAME OF PROJECT)  requirement that all three DELIVERABLES  must be integrated 
in the UK. A non -exclusivity requirement  for UK industry  formed a condition of entry 
into the competition to ensure viable bidders  were not bound to only one potential 
Prime Contractor.  This supported  the objective of creating a  level playing field for all 
Bidders to engage  with UK industry with recourse available to the Authority  to 
investigate where it had reason to believe the non -exclusivity rule s were not being 
adhered to .  
 
17. The Preferred  Bidder has adhered to the non -exclusivity rules throughout the 
competition and has  utilised  engagement opportunities with the Authority to mature its  
relationship and progress its Build Strategy . The contracting arrangement as proposed 
by the Preferred Bidder as Prime Contract or is sound and agreed with the Authority 
during contract negotiation , the latter being a Key Subcontractor. Accordingly , the 
Authority will have visibility of the head of terms between the Preferred Bidder and its 
chosen INDUSTRY  during Preferred Bidder stage . 
 
18. Following engagement with Bidder s throughout the competition  and 
development of their Pricing Schedules , it became apparent during Phase 2 of the 
CPP that none of the Bidders were in a position to offer a compliant bid with respect 
to the  initial £XXXX outturn budget . This was  predominantly due  to the change in 
global economic conditions since the start of the competition in DATE  specifically the 
rise in inflation and  resultant  impact on supply chain. As this was a challenge faced by 
all Bidders, it was deemed necessary to increase the budget accordingly  (by £XXXX 
in DATE  Economic Condition s) to £XXXX. As well as being informed by feedback from 
Bidders, the  increase was also supported by internal cost analysis . The Manufacture 
ITN process is clear in that the Authority has  the right to change any part of 
Procurement at any time.  Legal advice was also sought to ensure any risks pertinent 
to changing our Price requirement were captured and understood in terms of the ir 
likelihood and impact.  Any identified legal risks, namely challenge from participants to 
(NAME OF PROJECT)  Market Engagement  prior to the competition commencing , 
were deemed  very lo w likelihood. Ministerial approval was g iven to allow the 
competition to proceed  with the increase in budget in line with the flexibility allowed in 
the current Manufacture ITN  and Procurement Strategy.  
19. The vast majority of the Preferred Bidder’s Tendered Manufacture Contract 
accepts the positions included in the Draft Manufacture Contract without any 
amendments. Of the amendments made,  the majority either constitute a very minor or   
 
  
minor transfer in risk to the Authority  only. On this basis, there is a high level of 
confidence  that any updates required during Preferred Bidder stage would be few and 
non-substantive  in terms of finalising the Manufacture Contract  and are cosmetic in 
nature . Such updates would not constitute re -negotiation of the Preferred Bidder’s  
Manufacture Bid  which , notwithstanding the requirement to complete additional 
Preferred Bidder tasking, constitutes an offer capable of acceptance . It should be 
noted that the Preferred Bidder’s commitment to hold its price remains valid until XX 
XX DATE . After this point the Authority would be obliged to renegotiate  with the 
Preferred Bidder  in an uncompetitive environment to reach what would very likely be 
a far worse deal for Defence and the UK taxpayer.  
 
20. Remedies and Contractual Incentives  - In addition to the Preferred Bidder’s 
Social Value response,  summarised above at  para 15,  the T endered Manufacture 
Contract allows  the Authority to  withhold 150% of the v alue of Recapitalisation 
Milestones (the value of the relevant milestone plus an additional 50% which is 
withheld from any other milestone due for payment)  if they are not implemented by the 
Contractor . Additionally , a contractual termination right exists for the Authority where 
the recapitalisation programme is not delivered by a specified longstop date. This 
recognises the importance of the Contractor committing to investment in UK industry  
and provides incen tive to fulfilment of its Social Value obligations on contract  as a 
critical enabler to delivering to cost and schedule . 
 
21. Wider Incentives  – The Preferred Bidder’ s proposal for the UK industry  scope 
is predicated on the recapitalisation programme and therefore execution  of this capit al 
investment is essential to enable the contract to be executed successfully. Further , 
there will be significant reputational incentive  for the companies to complete the capital 
investment following public announcements being made.  
 
22. The Authority has also secured terms with respect to Liquidated Damages  
(LDs)  within the Tendered Manufacture Contract  broadly in line with the baseline 
position. Whilst it deviates slightly  in allowing a two-month  grace period (as opposed 
to one) for LDs post contract ed VAD, the Preferred Bidder has retained the  Authority 
proposed  run rate for LDs across the three DELIVERABLES  with a cap  of £ XXXX in 
aggregate. This represents a position whereby the Preferred Bidder would have to 
max out LDs for all of DELIVERABLE  1 and substantially so for DELIVERABLE  2 
before the cap was reached. On this basis, we are confident this provides adequate 
incentive to deliver on time , with respect to the Defence criticality of delivering  
DELIVERABLE  1 on time given the implications for LOCATION  run on costs. Similarly, 
there are Performance Liquidate d Damages  within the Manufacture Contract for 
deficiencies  against key performance commitments contained in  the Preferred 
Bidder’s Build Specification.  
 
23. Contingent Liabilities  - The Limit of Liability for both the Authority and 
Contractor under the Manufacture Contract is the Contract Price, except for the 
Authority’s liability in respect of Intellectual Property Rights ( IPR) and confidentiality 
breaches.  These carve outs from the Authority’s limit of liability are provided for within 
policy guidance and are low risk. DEFCON XXX was included within the baseline Draft 
Manufacture Contract to provide  a reciprocal indemnity against infringement of third -  
 
  
party IPR in their pre -approved and unamended form. The Preferred Bidder has 
included provision to make clear the Authority’s  intent that it will be indemnified for use 
of Authority Software and Background IPR. There is a low likelihood of a potential 
Contingent Liability relating to changes in UK Law.  
Financial Case  
 
24. Costs  - The Manufacture contract price is forecast to be £  X at outturn utilising 
CPI to determine  fixed priced milestones. This consists of;  
  
Manufacture Contract value make -up  Cost Element (£M)  
Average Production Cost (UPC) including 
design and all Non -Recurring Expenditure not 
broken out below  £ XXXX per DELIVERABLE   
Integrated Logistical Support (ILS) package, 
including Initial Training and Initial 
Provisioning of Spares  £XXXX  
Recapitalisation and Social Value programme 
of Industrial Productivity, Workforce 
Development and Environmental 
Sustainability initiatives  £XXXX  
(£XXXX additional Private Venture 
funding needs to be secured)  
Fixed Price Forecast Inflation (applying 
relevant indices)  £ XXXX 
Total outturn Manufacture Contract Price  £ XXXX 
  
25. The wider programme cost to deliver the platforms to Full Operating Capability 
(FOC) is £  XXXX outturn , including GFA and MOD risk provision. Detailed costs have 
been developed and assured through an iterative approach throughout the CPP by 
the Cost Assurance Group (CAG) as the Bidders’ cost analyses developed and 
validated through Independent Cost Estimat es (ICE) conducted at the midpoint of 
CPP.  
 
26. Inflation Risk  - The project has been costed inclusive of inflation using the 
latest Indigo forecast indices to uplift each relevant cost line. It is predicted that the 
greatest economic risk to the case is that inflation continues to remain high, 
significantly increasi ng beyond the Indigo forecasts. Such increases will impact 
milestone payments from Contract Award onwards (the project Manufacture Contract 
tendered being fixed price to CPI). It should be noted (at the time of writing) the Indigo 
forecasts indicates an op timistic sharp drop of inflation during the early contract period 
down to X% p.a. making it highly likely the forecast will be exceeded and contingency 
is required. Within Acquisition, CAG have created an independent forecast index 
utilising the Bank of England Monetary Policy Report (dated XX DATE  - providing a 
potential spread of worse case CPI forecasts) to reflect CPI increasing beyond the 
current Indigo CPI forecast up to a potential P90. Within the project it has been utilised 
to calculate a spread of  uncertainty against inflation risk. The calculation does not 
utilise the CAG indices as a ‘Maximum’ as the distinct inflation risk relates to only the 
Manufacture Contract. It is considered, for the distinct inflation risk, the Manufacture   
 
  
Contract could see a maximum X% increase beyond current CPI forecast in inflation 
due to global events. The CAG indices inform the Most Likely and the Minimum (the 
midpoint from the Indigo forecast to the CAG Indices). Whilst cost provision is set using 
Monte -Carlo techniques, approxim ately £ XXXX can be attributed to inflation provision.  
27. Affordability  - Financial detail is at Annex D.  The table below demonstrates 
the challenge within the budgetary ABC DATE  Control Total provision against the 
profile. Affordability of the Programme, ORGANISATION  and Defence context 
continues to be managed via the Cost Management Working Group (CMWG). An FCR 
has been submitted reflecting the adjustments needed to achieve the profile and 
subsequently to achieve implementation prior to contract award.

Management Case  
 
28. Schedule Deliverability  - The Preferred Bidder  has committed contractually to 
deliver all three  DELIVERABLES  by the end of DATE , through a distributed block build 
and integration strategy, with a contractual  date for DELIVERABLE  1 VAD of XX 
DATE . They have embraced the light governance and design management 
arrangements with a sharper focus on acceptance arrangements  which are aligned to 
an as built product as opposed to a design , limiting Authority risk for design change. 
The Preferred Bidder has  committed to the  investment in facilities, technology, and 
skills necessary to deliver the contract. They are committing to near deterministic 
contractual dates , with a narrow 3 -Point Estimate  spread,  based on their extensive 
delivery experience of projects of similar scale and complexity . This has resulted in 
float from previous project outturn  experience included in their baseline schedule. 
Using their own P50 VAD (which is later than  the committed contract VAD date ), the 
Authority holds extended schedule contingency of 14 months between DELIVERABLE  
1 VAD and P 50 ISD  and 18 months against the P70 ISD, for which  approval is being 
sought.  During Preferred Bidder stage the Authority will be seeking clarification as to 
this contingency to determine  any outstanding issues requiring management action 
and understand opportunities to improve.  
 
29. Deliverability has been a crucial element of C PP to mature  and build confidence 
in Bidders ’ delivery plans to underpin (NAME OF PROJECT) ’s contribution to 
transforming and sustaining UK industry . The C PP analysed Bidders’ draft  plans to 
deliver the full scope of the Manufacture  contract, including the Build Strategy, a fully 
resourced Integrated Performance Management Baseline (IPMB) with cost   
 
  
assurance, and coherent and effective management arrangements including those to 
deliver final design, acceptance, and ILS of the platforms.  
 
30. The BC, therefore , seeks approval of DELIVERABLE  1 ISD at X% confidence. 
This reflects the greater risk inherent in delivery of the first of class and the learning 
from assessment  of the Preferred B idder ’s intended schedule  (para 28 ). There are 
further schedule efficiencies  possible  through  tailoring the MOD programme between  
VAD and ISD to share trials across the DELIVERABLE  through  more detailed 
planning . The programme and project schedules will drive toward the P50 schedule 
as the baseline, to achieve ISD of DELIVERABLE  1 as early as possible to minimise 
the solid support availability shortfall during  transition . Milestones are at Annex E. 
 
31. Project resources  - A resource loaded Integrated Programme Management 
Baseline (IPMB) has been developed with  an organisational design to deliver the 
design, build and VAD to ISD phases. The project will be delivered by  the Production 
team  developed to deliver the project following contract award and principally matched 
to the contract management, assurance and acceptance activities and delivery of the 
wider MOD Programme. Continuity will be obtained through sustaining experienced 
resource from the Assessment Phase and augmenti ng with those with build phase 
experience, including Delivery Group ( PREVIOUS PROGRAMME ), private sector 
expertise, including  in commercial build oversight, and continued  SQEP in the  team . 
The project is expected to peak at about X staff FTE to manage the parallel build and 
VAD to ISD  programmes . 
 
32. GFA - Building on lessons from the PREVIOUS PROGRAMME  procurement, 
the (NAME OF PROJECT)  GFA strategy has been to follow the blended approach 
which seeks to : 
 
 a. maximise the volume of equipment to be procured directly  the Prime 
Contractor as part of the Manufacture Contract , fully integrated and hence 
reduce contract risk and increase  competitive scope. Market Engagement 
findings were enacted where  traditional GF systems are within the ability  of 
industry to supply ; 
 b. only supply  certain sensitive and protected systems where the contractor 
does not have permission to acquire into the contract, this has only be en 
undertaken on a strict case -by-case basis where risk can be demonstrated to 
be low ; 
 c. ensure remaining  MOD systems and equipment install ed and integrat ed in  
a separate CIP which will occur immediately following VAD. Where t his require s 
additional critical path time to ISD, it must demonstrate  that this is lower impact 
than the implications of fit ting GFA in build ; and 
 d. ensure th at the  Prime Contractor provides under the scope of the 
Manufacture C ontract the Fit -To-Receive  (FTR) or Space Weight Power and 
Services  (SWAPS) . This is the approach where the equipment solutions are 
unknown or very immature .  FTR is a common approach where equipment 
availability is prioritised on an operational basis, and SWAPS allows an element 
of future proofing for capability choice to be managed through life. 
   
 
  
33. Environmental  - The (NAME OF PROJECT)  design incorporates several  
environmental features to enable (NAME OF PROJECT)  as the Environmental 
Sustainability pathfinder to pioneer the way for greener MOD procurements. At the 
start of life, (NAME OF PROJECT)  DELIVERABLES  will be equipped with energy 
efficiency technologies to reduce power demand and will have the capability to reduce 
their carbon intensity by REDACTED . The DELIVERABLE  have been designed so that 
mid-life power and propulsion modification and upgrades can be achieved  without 
significant work in way . Compartment space  and design  including margins for energy 
saving devices , with associated removal routes , will enable change  as carbon free 
CAPABILITY  evolves . Wider contributions to Net Zero are promoted through  the 
manufacturing facilities and industry  commitment  to improv e sustainability and climate 
change culture within their workforce, driving sustainable procurement into the supply 
chain, minimising waste , and discharge, and committing to update their facilities to 
support the UK Governments ’ Net Zero over the next X years.  
34. Equipment  - In addition to the Manufacture Contract , provision has been made 
for the development of , and transition  to, steady state  training . This includes software 
upgrade s, and an upgrade to the training facility if identified by the Training Needs 
Analyses.  The u se of simulation and synthetic training has and will be encouraged . 
 
35. Personnel  - The winning solution has met the SofS challenge and has 
demonstrated  through operability testing that a core crew could safely operate in their 
core role.  The challenge now will be to grow the additional strength required to operate 
3 DELIVERABLES , vice 1 , and at  a higher level of availability.  To achieve this, the 
(NAME OF PROJECT)  personnel requirements are already funded within the long -
term personnel forecast and growth plan.  The DELIBERABLES  will play a key role in 
maintaining that growth . 
 
36. Infra structure  - The (NAME OF PROJECT)  Programmes have always sought 
to avoid significant infrastructure investment by setting the physical constraints of 
platform size . The winning solution has met these constraints,  so no infrastructure 
changes are envisaged .  
 
37. Support  - The Through Life including Equipment Support ( ESP) costs are  at 
Annex F. ESP costs have been included in ABC costings since ABC  DATE . This 
reflects the most up to date survey and maintenance cycle now in use and preferred , 
which maximises availability . It also allows for additional time in hand and material , 
environmental compliance,  and obsolescence updates at the X and X-year points but  
does not include the cost of capability or equipment upgrades  (Customer choice and 
funding required ). The cost of preparing for disposal at end of life  is included .  
 
38. This FBC does not seek approval to commit to the In -Service Support (ISS) 
solution , and the support strategy  and products give freedom of choice  in ISS 
approach . The favoured route  is via assess ment  and deliver y through the 
(PROGRAMME NAME ) programme; which recognises (NAME OF PROJECT)  as a 
customer as is heads towards SOC by end of DATE . The initial support solution (circa 
X years if PROGRAMME NAME  is insufficient mature for immediate (NAME OF 
PROJECT)  transition and determined by the Delivery Team in conjunction with the in -
service  team via competition) and documentation generated by the (NAME OF   
 
  
PROJECT)  project will allow the synchronisation with and transition to the 
PROGRAMME NAME  solution (due progressively around the same timeline as 
(NAME OF PROJECT)  ISD). This replicates how CAPABILITY  transitioned into the 
current ISS arrangement.   
 
39. Risks  - The top risks pertinent to the next phase from contract award and out 
to Transition into Service are reflective of the challenges in delivering to cost, 
performance / quality, and time. Clearly the volatility of current economic conditions is 
reflected in the inflation risk with its associated cost escalation impact which is at 
present seen as the biggest or closest threat. Three of the top risks are related to or 
have potential impact on schedule and maintaining capability during the transition into 
servic e period. And two relate to supplier performance and/or quality. Early and 
successful mobilisation of the resource during Preferred Bidder stage are a major 
mitigation to ensure th e required UK capability and skills can be developed to 
successfully  execute the programme.   
 
Presentation and Handling  
 
40. (NAME OF PROJECT)  continues to be a high -profile project with considerable 
interest from MPs, Unions, industry and the media . The MinSub  to support the 
approval of the Preferred Bidder in xx DATE  will also contain a handling plan. It  will 
cover how the Preferred Bidder appointment should be made, and the pros  and cons  
of making an announcement then, or in late xx DATE , at contract award . A cross 
Departmental comms group has been stood up to ensure any announcement is 
effectively coordinated across Whitehall.  Information requests will be co -ordinated 
through Secretariat and NAME OF DEPARTMENT  Policy and Secretariat and 
agreed with Media and DDC Press Offices ahead of any announcement s. The SRO 
approved (NAME OF PROJECT)  lines to take (LTT)  continue to be updated  on a 
regular basis.

(NAME OF PROJECT)  PREFERRED BIDDER (DELIVERABLE ) DESIGN  
The evaluation has shown that the winning design will in many cases exceed the core 
capability set as the minimum requirement and offers capability adaptability pathways for 
future roles and carbon reduction adaptability pathways for exploitation through l ife.  
Preferred Bidder Capability Overview   
  
Highlights of the Preferred Bidder’s design against the KURs are summarised below.  
 
1. In meeting  KUR1  and KUR  2 the design  exceeds  the threshold  requirements,  with 
capacity  for XX. This represents  approximately  90% of the objective  capacity  requirement.  An 
individual  (NAME OF PROJECT)  can support  REDACTED  
 
2. KUR  3 – (NAME OF PROJECT)  will have  XX. This will enable  XX. In addition  this 
will allow  XX.  
 
3. KUR  4 The winning  design  meets  the threshold  level of capability . Any capability  
above  threshold  was highly  valued by the Customer , reduces  pressure  elsewhere  and offers  
flexibility .  
 
4. KUR  5 This satisfies  the consolidation  model  concept  which  is reliant  on the timely  
arrival  of DELIVERABLE  2. The flexibility  afforded  by this model  maximises  operational  
freedom,  reduces  risk of single  point  failures  and reduces  the burden  on the supply  chain.   
 
5. KUR  6 The design  ensures  XX. 
 
6. As well as the operational  adaptabilities  there  are also adaptable  pathways  for Carbon  
Reduction  through  life.  
7. The winning  design  has demonstrated , through  operability  scenario  testing,  to be able 
to meet  the SofS  challenge .

Through Life and  ESP Costs  
 
 
 
The Table above provides the combined forecast for both future Equipment Support 
Programme (ESP) commitment and Through Life Costs (TLC).  
ESP cost estimates have been produced using a number of data sets which include 
tendered costs from the current In -Service Support (ISS) contracts, actual historical 
maintenance outturn costs escalated to appropriate rates, current Support ( NAME OF 
DEPARTMENT ) ABC DATE b udget, and costs submitted by the bidder, appropriately 
adjusted for realism. These costs include maintenance, post -design services, spares 
provision, equipment obsolescence and software updates.  
The ESP cost estimate has been complimented with through life cost forecasts for staffing, 
victualling, travel and subsistence, fuels, lubricants and training to derive the total 10%, 50% 
and 90% costs detailed in the Table above.  
All costs have been profiled against the (NAME OF PROJECT)  Operating and Support 
Philosophy that requires a combination of routine maintenance (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly 
etc), Assisted/Self Maintenance Periods, Annual Certification Periods (ACPs)  and Contractor 
Support Periods (CSP) at a 5 -Annual frequency.
