Introduction

Rain-screen cladding typically comprises of an outer skin of panels (ie. the rain-screen), an

air cavity and a backing wall. The rain-screen panels are supported off rails, fixed to either a
built-up backing wall (such as masonry, SFS, concrete or composite insulation panels) or to
the opaque areas of curtain walling (either stick or unitised). The cavity located behind the

rain-screen cladding panels may be “drained and ventilated” or “pressure-equalised”.

What to check on site

* Check that onsite conditions are suitable for installation.

* Cross check the onsite installation against the relevant construction issue drawings. Is
the installation as per the agreed design?

© Take spot check measurements of the width of the horizontal and vertical joints

between panels. Are they within the specified /design tolerances?

© Check whether the joints are open or sealed, as per the design.

© Inspect that the cavity behind the panels is the correct depth.

© Inspect whether the drainage paths are clear. Make sure there are no obstructions in

the drainage route.

* Check that frame drainage integral to window, door and curtain wall systems is

accommodated at the sill, reveal and head interfaces.

© Inspect whether the rails are correctly positioned, as per the design.

© Inspect whether the fixings and fasteners are the right type/shape and correctly
positioned, as per the design.

« Where the backing wall is a framed back wall, check that any brackets supporting the
rain screen are fixed to the studs or to horizontal rails that are fixed to the studs.

* Check whether the type, thickness and location of insulation is as per the design.

* Inspect whether any compartment barriers or cavity closers are correctly positioned.

© Check that any breather membranes / vapour control layers are correctly positioned
and are sealed around penetrations (such as brackets), windows, doors and curtain
walling systems.

¢ Inspect whether thermal separators are included between brackets and supporting
structure as per the design.

The bracket has a levelling screw to allow
adjustment of the panel location and a
locking screw to prevent movement of the
panel when in the correct position.
