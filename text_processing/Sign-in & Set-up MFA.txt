How To Sign in & Set Up Multi-Factor Authentication

To access the Projecting Success Hack Environment, you will need to set up Multi-Factor
Authentication. You can set this up with the same app and email you use at work; it will not affect
your work account.

The Microsoft Authenticator App is very good at keeping things separate, and the connection you set
up to the Projecting Success Hack Environment will be treated as a completely separate environment

from what you already use for work.
